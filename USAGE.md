## Getting Started

### Installation Verification

After installation, verify the skill is working:

```
"Hello, are you ready to help me create skills?"
```

Expected response: The AI should acknowledge and offer to help with CREATE, EVALUATE, or OPTIMIZE modes.

### First Skill Creation

Let's create a simple skill:

```
"Create a skill that greets users by name"
```

The AI will:
1. Ask 6 elicitation questions
2. Select the Base template
3. Generate the skill
4. Show you the result

## CREATE Mode Examples

### Example 1: API Integration Skill

**User Request:**
```
"Create a skill for fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap API"
```

**Elicitation Process:**
The AI will ask:
1. What's the primary goal? → "Fetch current weather and forecasts"
2. Who are the target users? → "Developers and end users"
3. What capabilities must it have? → "Current weather, 5-day forecast, location search"
4. Any constraints? → "Need API key, rate limits"
5. Expected scale? → "100 requests/day"
6. Any references? → "Similar to weather.com API"

**Generated Skill Structure:**
```yaml
name: weather-api-skill
version: 1.0.0
description: Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
template: api-integration
```

### Example 2: Data Pipeline Skill

**User Request:**
```
"Create a skill that processes CSV files and generates reports"
```

**Key Features Generated:**
- CSV parsing with validation
- Data transformation steps
- Report generation in multiple formats
- Error handling for malformed data

### Example 3: Workflow Automation Skill

**User Request:**
```
"Create a skill that automates GitHub issue management"
```

**Generated Components:**
- Issue creation from templates
- Label management
- Assignment automation
- Notification triggers

### Template Selection Guide

| Use Case | Recommended Template | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| Simple utility | Base | Minimal boilerplate |
| External API | API Integration | Built-in auth patterns |
| Data processing | Data Pipeline | Validation & transformation |
| CI/CD tasks | Workflow Automation | Step sequencing |

## EVALUATE Mode Examples

### Example 1: Basic Evaluation

**User Request:**
```
"Evaluate this skill"
```

**AI Process:**
1. Parse the skill file
2. Run 4-phase evaluation
3. Generate score report

**Sample Output:**
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Iterative Refinement

**Workflow:**
```
1. CREATE: Generate initial skill
2. EVALUATE: Identify issues
3. OPTIMIZE: Fix issues
4. EVALUATE: Verify improvements
5. Repeat until satisfied
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Create a database query skill"
[Skill created with score 720]

User: "Evaluate this skill"
[Issues identified: missing error handling, unclear examples]

User: "Optimize this skill"
[Optimized to 890]

User: "Evaluate again"
[Confirmed: 890/1000, GOLD tier]
```

### Pattern 2: Template Customization

**Creating a custom template:**
```
"Create a skill using a custom template for machine learning models"
```

**Custom Template Structure:**
```yaml
name: ml-model-skill
template: custom
sections:
  - Model Architecture
  - Training Data
  - Hyperparameters
  - Evaluation Metrics
  - Deployment
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Platform Deployment

**Building for multiple platforms:**
```bash
cd builder
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js build --platform all

# Results in:
# platforms/skill-writer-opencode-dev.md
# platforms/skill-writer-openclaw-dev.md
# platforms/skill-writer-claude-dev.md
# platforms/skill-writer-cursor-dev.md
# platforms/skill-writer-openai-dev.json
# platforms/skill-writer-gemini-dev.md
```

### Pattern 4: Batch Processing

**Creating multiple skills:**
```
"Create skills for: 1) Email validation, 2) Phone formatting, 3) Address parsing"
```

The AI will create all three skills in sequence.

## Best Practices

### For Skill Creators

1. **Be Specific**: Clear requirements lead to better skills
   - ❌ "Create a good skill"
   - ✅ "Create a skill that validates email addresses with regex"

2. **Answer Elicitation Questions**: Provide detailed answers for better results

3. **Test Triggers**: Verify trigger phrases work as expected

4. **Iterate**: Use EVALUATE and OPTIMIZE to improve

5. **Security First**: Always run security checks before deployment

### For Skill Users

1. **Use Exact Triggers**: Trigger phrases are case-sensitive

2. **Provide Context**: More context = better results
   - ❌ "Fix this"
   - ✅ "Optimize this skill for better error handling"

3. **Review Changes**: Always review optimized skills before using

4. **Version Control**: Keep backups of working skills

### For Platform Admins

1. **Regular Evaluation**: Periodically evaluate installed skills

2. **Security Audits**: Run security checks on all skills

3. **Update Templates**: Keep templates current with best practices

4. **Monitor Usage**: Track which skills are most used

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Tips and Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Mode Chaining

Chain modes for best results:
```
CREATE → EVALUATE → OPTIMIZE → EVALUATE
```

### Tip 2: Save Checkpoints

Before optimizing, save a copy:
```
"Save a backup of this skill before optimizing"
```

### Tip 3: Targeted Optimization

Be specific about what to optimize:
```
"Optimize only the security aspects of this skill"
```

### Tip 4: Compare Versions

Compare before and after:
```
"Show me what changed in the optimization"
```

### Tip 5: Custom Requirements

Add specific requirements:
```
"Create a skill that handles errors gracefully and logs to console"
```
