# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.x.x   | :x:                |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Skill Writer, please send an email to security@skill-writer.org. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: What could be compromised
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Proof of Concept**: If available, provide a PoC
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Initial Assessment | Within 1 week |
| Fix Development | Depends on severity |
| Disclosure | After fix is released |

### Severity Levels

- **Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**: Immediate response, fix within 7 days
- **High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**: Urgent response, fix within 30 days
- **Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**: Standard response, fix within 90 days
- **Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**: Planned response, fix in next release

## Security Scanning

Our project undergoes regular security scanning for the following vulnerability categories:

### CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
We scan for:
- Hard-coded passwords or API keys
- Default credentials
- Exposed secrets in configuration files

### CWE-89: SQL Injection
We scan for:
- Unparameterized SQL queries
- Dynamic query construction
- User input in SQL statements

### CWE-78: OS Command Injection
We scan for:
- Unsanitized user input in system calls
- Shell command construction
- Process execution vulnerabilities

### CWE-22: Path Traversal
We scan for:
- Unsanitized file paths
- Directory traversal sequences
- File access vulnerabilities

### OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (ASI01–ASI10)
We scan for agentic-specific vulnerabilities including:
- **ASI01**: Prompt Injection / Goal Hijack (P1 — −50 pts)
- **ASI02**: Insecure Tool Use (P1 — −50 pts)
- **ASI03**: Excessive Agency (P1 — −50 pts)
- **ASI04**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption / Supply Chain (P1 — −30 pts)
- **ASI05–ASI10**: Advisory patterns (P2 — reported but not blocking)

### Supply Chain Trust Verification (v3.4.0)

Context: The Snyk supply-chain threat model study (2026-02) audited 3,984 skills from ClawHub and skills.sh —
**13.4% had critical-level issues**; **36.82% had at least one security flaw**. The supply-chain threat model
campaign injected 300+ malicious skills via compromised registry entries. Skills from untrusted
sources must be treated as hostile until verified.

We enforce a **5-tier trust model** for all external skills (full spec: `refs/security-patterns.md §6`):

| Trust Tier | Source | Required Scan |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| `TRUSTED` | Self-authored in current session | Standard CWE + OWASP scan |
| `VERIFIED` | Signed registry entry (SHA-256 verified) | Standard CWE + OWASP scan |
| `UNVERIFIED` | Public registry, no signature | Full scan + warn user before install |
| `LOW_TRUST` | Fork/modified version of known skill | Full scan + diff against original |
| `UNTRUSTED` | Direct URL fetch / unknown origin | P0 scan + ABORT on any P1 + explicit user sign-off |

**SHA-256 verification**: INSTALL mode computes or verifies the SHA-256 hash of downloaded
skill files against the registry-published `sha256:` field. Mismatch → ABORT immediately.

**Anti-patterns** caught by supply chain scan (see `optimize/anti-patterns.md §H`):
- **H1 UNTRUSTED_PULL**: Installing external skills without signature verification
- **H2 SKILL_INJECTION**: ASI01 prompt injection patterns in skill body text
- **H3 UNPINNED_DEPENDENCY**: Missing `version_constraint:` in `depends_on:` edges
- **H4 SIMILARITY_HIJACK**: Malicious skill claiming high similarity score to a trusted skill

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Review Dependencies**: Regularly audit your dependencies
3. **Enable Security Features**: Use available security configurations
4. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious behavior immediately

### For Contributors

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Secure Defaults**: Use secure default configurations
3. **Least Privilege**: Follow principle of least privilege
4. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging

## Security Tools

We use the following tools for security:

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Security issue tracking

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
5. Publicly disclose the issue after patches are available
