## Abstract

The proliferation of large language model (LLM)-based agents has created an urgent need for systematic engineering approaches to AI skill development. Unlike traditional software, agent skills encompass complex behavioral specifications that must exhibit consistent performance across diverse execution contexts. This paper presents **Agent Skills Engineering**, a comprehensive methodology for managing the complete lifecycle of AI agent skills, from initial specification through autonomous optimization to production certification.

The proposed approach addresses three fundamental challenges in the field: (1) the lack of standardized skill representation formats that balance human readability with machine executability, (2) the absence of reliable evaluation frameworks that capture both textual quality and runtime effectiveness, and (3) the need for autonomous optimization mechanisms that can iteratively improve skill performance without manual intervention. We introduce a **multi-agent optimization architecture** that employs parallel evaluation across five specialized agents—Security, Trigger, Runtime, Quality, and EdgeCase—operating under a deterministic improvement selection protocol.

Our methodology incorporates a **dual-track validation system** that ensures alignment between documented specifications and actual runtime behavior, enforced through a variance threshold mechanism. The optimization framework follows a seven-step autonomous loop: Analyze, Plan, Implement, Verify, Error handling, Log, and Commit, achieving an expected improvement rate of 20-30 experiments per hour. Through systematic application of this methodology, we demonstrate that agent skills can be consistently elevated to CERTIFIED status, defined as achieving Text Score ≥ 8.0, Runtime Score ≥ 8.0, and Variance < 1.0, with a target Overall Score ≥ 9.0.

This work establishes the theoretical foundation and practical tooling for treating AI agent skills as first-class engineering artifacts, enabling the construction of reliable, measurable, and continuously improvable agentic systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Context

The emergence of foundation models capable of natural language understanding and generation has catalyzed the development of AI agent systems that can autonomously plan, reason, and execute complex tasks. These agents derive their capabilities from **skills**—structured specifications that define behavior, workflows, decision frameworks, and error handling protocols. As organizations increasingly deploy multi-agent systems in production environments, the quality and reliability of individual skills become critical determinants of overall system performance.

However, the engineering of agent skills remains predominantly ad hoc. Practitioners typically develop skills through iterative prompting, relying on subjective assessments of quality and manual debugging when failures occur. This approach suffers from three fundamental limitations that constrain the reliability and scalability of agent deployments.

First, **skill specifications lack standardized quality metrics**. While the agentskills.io open standard (v2.1.0) provides a structured format for skill definition, existing evaluation approaches remain largely heuristic, failing to capture the multi-dimensional nature of skill quality. A skill's effectiveness cannot be reduced to a single scalar; it encompasses correctness of domain knowledge, clarity of workflow specification, robustness of error handling, and appropriateness of examples for guiding model behavior.

Second, **evaluation methodologies fail to capture runtime effectiveness**. Traditional skill assessment focuses on textual quality—readability, completeness, and internal consistency of documentation. However, the ultimate measure of a skill's value is its effectiveness at runtime: Does the agent behave consistently with its specification? Does it maintain role immersion across extended conversations? Does it appropriately apply prescribed frameworks when triggered? The disconnect between text quality and runtime performance represents a significant source of deployment failures.

Third, **optimization processes remain manual and unsystematic**. When a skill underperforms, practitioners typically resort to trial-and-error refinement of prompts, without systematic diagnosis of underlying deficiencies. This approach is both time-consuming and unreliable, yielding inconsistent results across practitioners and domains.

### 1.2 Contributions

This paper makes three primary contributions to the field of AI agent engineering:

1. **A Multi-Dimensional Skill Quality Framework**: We present a comprehensive scoring system spanning six dimensions—System Prompt (20%), Domain Knowledge (20%), Workflow (20%), Error Handling (15%), Examples (15%), and Metadata (10%)—that provides reproducible quality assessments grounded in explicit evaluation criteria. This framework enables practitioners to diagnose specific deficiencies and track improvement systematically.

2. **A Dual-Track Validation Architecture**: We introduce a validation approach that simultaneously evaluates textual specifications and runtime behavior, computing a variance metric that ensures alignment between documented behavior and actual execution. This architecture addresses the critical gap between documentation quality and operational effectiveness.

3. **An Autonomous Multi-Agent Optimization Methodology**: We present a systematic optimization loop that leverages parallel execution of specialized agents to identify weaknesses, implement targeted improvements, and verify results without manual intervention. The methodology follows a deterministic improvement selection protocol that ensures reproducible progress toward quality targets.

### 1.3 Results Summary

The proposed methodology achieves the following quantitative outcomes when applied systematically:

- **Text Score ≥ 9.0**: Skills optimized through this methodology consistently achieve exemplary text quality ratings, with specific improvements targeting the weakest dimensions as identified through the scoring framework.
- **Runtime Score ≥ 8.0**: Dual-track validation ensures that runtime effectiveness meets production readiness thresholds, with minimum floor values enforced for critical dimensions including Role Immersion, Knowledge Accuracy, and Long-Conversation Stability.
- **Variance < 1.0**: The absolute difference between Text Score and Runtime Score remains below 1.0, ensuring that documented specifications accurately reflect operational behavior.

These targets define the **CERTIFIED** status, indicating production readiness, while scores ≥ 9.0 achieve **EXEMPLARY** status, suitable for serving as benchmarks for skill development.

### 1.4 Paper Structure

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on the agent skills landscape, including existing frameworks and their limitations; Section 3 details the proposed methodology, including the quality framework, validation architecture, and optimization loop; Section 4 presents experimental results and case studies; Section 5 discusses related work and positioning; and Section 6 concludes with directions for future work.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The Agent Skills Landscape

The development of LLM-based agents has given rise to multiple frameworks that attempt to provide reusable skill and capability abstractions. Understanding the landscape of these approaches is essential for contextualizing the contributions of this work.

**AutoGen** (Microsoft, 2023) provides a multi-agent conversation framework where agents are defined through system messages and can be configured to collaborate on tasks through structured message passing. AutoGen's approach emphasizes runtime flexibility and supports dynamic agent composition. However, AutoGen treats skills as implicit in agent configurations rather than as first-class artifacts with dedicated specifications, evaluation protocols, or optimization mechanisms. Skills developed for AutoGen lack standardized representation formats, making it difficult to compare quality across implementations or transfer skills between environments.

**LangChain** (LangChain Inc., 2022) offers a comprehensive ecosystem for building agent applications, including a robust framework for defining tools, chains, and agents. LangChain's agent abstractions provide structured approaches to task decomposition and execution, with built-in support for various reasoning strategies including ReAct, CoT, and ToT. The framework includes evaluation capabilities through LangSmith, which supports tracing, metrics collection, and performance assessment. However, LangChain's evaluation approach focuses primarily on functional correctness and task completion rates, without addressing the multi-dimensional quality aspects of skill specifications that determine maintainability, clarity, and alignment between documentation and behavior.

**CrewAI** (CrewAI Inc., 2023) introduces an organizational metaphor for multi-agent systems, where agents operate as members of structured crews with defined roles, goals, and processes. CrewAI emphasizes collaborative task execution through role-based task assignment and hierarchical process management. The framework provides mechanisms for defining agent capabilities and coordinating multi-agent workflows. However, similar to AutoGen, CrewAI does not establish formal quality standards or evaluation methodologies for the skill specifications that define agent roles and behaviors.

The **agentskills.io** open standard (v2.1.0) represents an important contribution to the field by establishing a formal specification format for agent skills. The standard defines a structured SKILL.md format that encompasses identity definition, framework specification, thinking patterns, workflow definitions, error handling protocols, and example scenarios. This standardization enables interoperability between tools and provides a common foundation for skill development and sharing.

Despite its contributions, the agentskills.io standard focuses primarily on format specification without addressing evaluation methodology or optimization mechanisms. Skills adhering to the standard can be validated for structural compliance, but their substantive quality—accuracy of domain knowledge, clarity of workflows, robustness of error handling—remains subject to subjective assessment. Furthermore, the standard provides no mechanisms for autonomous improvement of skill quality once initial specifications are created.

### 2.2 Challenges in Skill Evaluation

The evaluation of agent skills presents unique challenges that distinguish it from traditional software quality assurance. These challenges stem from the inherent complexity of natural language specifications and the context-dependent nature of LLM behavior.

**Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment**: Agent skill quality cannot be captured through a single metric. A skill may exhibit excellent domain knowledge while possessing inadequate error handling, or provide comprehensive examples while lacking clear workflow definitions. Existing evaluation approaches tend to focus on isolated dimensions without establishing systematic relationships between them. The scoring framework presented in this paper addresses this limitation through a weighted multi-dimensional approach where each dimension contributes to an overall quality score according to established importance weights.

**The Text-Runtime Alignment Problem**: A critical challenge in skill engineering is ensuring that documented specifications accurately reflect actual agent behavior at runtime. This alignment problem arises because skills are typically written by humans who may inadvertently specify behaviors that differ from what the underlying model actually produces. Traditional evaluation methodologies address either textual quality or runtime effectiveness in isolation, failing to detect scenarios where a skill's documentation and behavior diverge significantly. The dual-track validation architecture proposed in this work explicitly addresses this gap through variance computation.

**Deterministic Weakness Identification**: Effective optimization requires systematic identification of the weakest aspects of a skill. However, existing approaches often rely on subjective assessment or random variation in improvement attempts, leading to inconsistent and non-reproducible results. The deterministic improvement selection protocol introduced in this work ensures that weakness identification follows explicit rules based on dimensional scores, eliminating arbitrary selection and enabling reproducible optimization trajectories.

**Evaluation Consistency and Anti-Gaming**: As quality metrics become consequential for skill certification, practitioners face incentives to game evaluation systems through superficial improvements that inflate scores without genuine quality enhancement. Effective evaluation frameworks must incorporate anti-gaming mechanisms that detect keyword stuffing, placeholder content, and other forms of manipulation. The multi-agent scoring approach with cross-validation addresses this challenge through multiple independent evaluation paths.

### 2.3 The Need for Autonomous Optimization

The manual optimization of agent skills suffers from inherent limitations in scalability, consistency, and efficiency that motivate the autonomous optimization approach presented in this work.

**Scalability Constraints**: As organizations develop portfolios of specialized skills for diverse operational contexts, manual optimization becomes prohibitively expensive. Each skill requires dedicated attention from experienced practitioners who must diagnose deficiencies, design improvements, implement changes, and verify results. The autonomous optimization methodology eliminates this bottleneck by enabling systematic improvement without continuous human oversight.

**Inconsistency in Manual Processes**: Different practitioners applying different diagnostic frameworks and improvement strategies yield inconsistent results even when optimizing identical skills. This inconsistency undermines reliability and makes it difficult to establish confidence in skill quality. The deterministic protocols of autonomous optimization ensure that identical input conditions always produce identical optimization trajectories, enabling reproducible quality improvement.

**Inefficiency of Trial-and-Error Approaches**: Manual optimization typically proceeds through unsystematic experimentation, attempting improvements in arbitrary order and retaining changes based on subjective assessments of effectiveness. This approach wastes resources on low-impact improvements while potentially missing high-impact opportunities. The weighted dimensional framework ensures that optimization efforts focus on the most impactful weaknesses first, following an evidence-based prioritization scheme.

**Continuous Quality Degradation**: Skills deployed in production environments are subject to quality degradation as underlying models evolve, operational contexts change, and accumulated modifications introduce inconsistencies. Manual maintenance cannot keep pace with these changes at scale. The autonomous optimization methodology enables continuous quality monitoring and improvement, maintaining skill quality over time without dedicated human effort.

The **self-optimization capability** described in this work implements a complete answer to these challenges. Triggered when practitioner input contains "自优化" (self-optimization) or "self-optimize" directives, the system activates a seven-step optimization loop that systematically analyzes current state, identifies weaknesses, implements targeted improvements, verifies results through dual-track validation, handles errors through established recovery protocols, logs progress for accountability, and commits improvements on a regular cadence. This autonomous operation achieves improvement rates of 20-30 experiments per hour, enabling skills to reach CERTIFIED status within 2-4 hours of autonomous work.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dual-Track Validation Framework

The dual-track validation framework constitutes the foundational evaluation infrastructure of the optimization system. This approach recognizes that skill quality cannot be adequately assessed through textual analysis alone; rather, a comprehensive evaluation must encompass both the documented specification and actual runtime behavior. The framework maintains two independent scoring channels that must converge for a skill to achieve certification.

#### 3.1.1 Text Quality Scoring

Text quality evaluation employs a six-dimensional rubric that assesses the structural and content completeness of skill documentation. Each dimension carries a specific weight reflecting its relative importance to overall skill quality, derived from empirical analysis of optimization rounds spanning over 70 iterations across multiple skill domains.

| Dimension | Weight | Score Range | Excellence Criteria |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| System Prompt | 20% | 0–10 | §1.1 Identity + §1.2 Framework + §1.3 Thinking |
| Domain Knowledge | 20% | 0–10 | Quantitative benchmarks, specific case studies |
| Workflow | 20% | 0–10 | 4–6 phases with explicit Done/Fail criteria |
| Error Handling | 15% | 0–10 | Named failure modes, recovery steps, anti-patterns |
| Examples | 15% | 0–10 | 5+ scenarios with realistic inputs and outputs |
| Metadata | 10% | 0–10 | Frontmatter completeness, trigger alignment |

The System Prompt dimension evaluates three mandatory subsections: the Identity section (§1.1) establishing the agent's role and expertise boundaries; the Framework section (§1.2) defining architectural components, available tools, and memory structures; and the Thinking section (§1.3) articulating cognitive processing patterns. Skills lacking any of these subsections receive a maximum ceiling of 6.0 regardless of other qualities, enforcing structural completeness as a prerequisite for excellence.

Domain Knowledge assessment prioritizes quantitative specificity over generic assertions. The rubric penalizes undefined references such as "McKinsey report" or "industry best practices" without supporting specifics. Excellence requires concrete data points including benchmarks (e.g., "128K context window"), named frameworks (e.g., "ReAct", "Chain-of-Thought"), and measurable outcomes (e.g., "16.7% error reduction"). This emphasis on specificity ensures that skills encode actionable knowledge rather than aspirational descriptions.

The Workflow dimension requires explicit definition of 4–6 processing phases, each accompanied by explicit Done criteria specifying conditions for phase completion and Fail criteria identifying irrecoverable error states. This formalization enables both human reviewers and automated systems to verify that skill execution follows defined pathways with unambiguous termination conditions.

Error Handling evaluation assesses coverage of named failure modes, documented recovery strategies, and identified anti-patterns. The rubric distinguishes between generic error messages and specific recovery procedures; a skill demonstrating "retry with exponential backoff" scores higher than one merely stating "handle errors gracefully."

Examples assessment requires minimum five scenarios with fully specified inputs, expected outputs, and verification steps. Generic scenarios receive lower scores than those containing realistic data structures, specific domain parameters, and explicit validation criteria enabling automated verification.

Metadata evaluation confirms frontmatter compliance with the agentskills specification, including name uniqueness, description accuracy, license specification, and version consistency. Additionally, the description field must correctly trigger pattern matching to ensure discoverability.

#### 3.1.2 Runtime Effectiveness Scoring

Runtime evaluation operates through a separate scoring channel that validates actual skill behavior against expected specifications. This channel executes skill implementations under controlled conditions and measures behavioral fidelity to documented specifications. The runtime channel employs black-box testing methodology, invoking skills through standardized interfaces and assessing outputs against expected results without access to internal implementation details.

The runtime evaluation protocol encompasses five validation categories:

**Identity Consistency Verification** confirms that the executing skill maintains coherent self-representation across extended interactions. This verification proceeds by engaging the skill in extended conversation sequences designed to test identity boundaries. For example, prompts challenging the skill to adopt conflicting roles test whether the skill maintains its defined identity or exhibits boundary drift. Similarly, requests exceeding the skill's defined scope test whether appropriate boundary enforcement occurs.

**Framework Execution Testing** validates that the skill correctly invokes specified tools, accesses defined memory structures, and follows documented architectural patterns. This testing category compares execution traces against expected patterns derived from the Framework section documentation.

**Output Actionability Assessment** measures the proportion of skill outputs that enable direct subsequent action. This assessment categorizes skill outputs along an actionability spectrum ranging from fully actionable (precise specifications enabling immediate execution) through partially actionable (direction provided but requiring additional specification) to non-actionable (vague or incomplete responses).

**Knowledge Accuracy Verification** cross-references skill outputs against known factual corpora within the skill's domain. This validation detects hallucinations or outdated information that may have crept into skill specifications.

**Conversation Stability Testing** evaluates skill performance across extended multi-turn interactions, measuring consistency of behavior, memory correctness over time, and absence of cumulative degradation patterns.

#### 3.1.3 Variance Control

Variance between text score and runtime score constitutes a critical quality indicator reflecting the degree of alignment between documented specifications and actual implementation behavior. The certification formula requires:

```
CERTIFIED = (Text Score ≥ 8.0) AND (Runtime Score ≥ 8.0) AND (Variance < 1.0)
```

Variance exceeding 1.0 indicates disagreement between documented specification and actual behavior—a condition termed **specification-behavior divergence**. Variance exceeding 2.0 triggers immediate red-flag status, indicating either excellent documentation of poor implementation or poorly documented but accidentally functional implementation.

The variance computation follows a symmetric absolute difference formulation: Variance = |Text Score - Runtime Score|. This formulation treats over-documentation (text exceeds runtime) and under-documentation (runtime exceeds text) as equally problematic.

Stability checks complement variance control by ensuring evaluation consistency across multiple runs. The stability verification protocol runs each evaluation three times and confirms identical results, detecting non-deterministic evaluation behavior.

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Parallel Optimization

The multi-agent architecture decomposes the optimization problem across five specialized agent types, each responsible for evaluating and improving specific skill aspects.

#### 3.2.1 Agent Type Specifications

**Security Agent** maintains responsibility for anti-pattern detection, injection risk identification, and data leakage prevention. This agent implements validation gates aligned with OWASP guidelines and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. Specific checks include detection of hardcoded credentials (CWE-798), command injection vectors (CWE-77), improper input validation (CWE-20), and path traversal vulnerabilities. The Security Agent carries P0 priority—security issues require immediate remediation regardless of other quality dimensions.

**Trigger Agent** focuses on pattern recognition accuracy and trigger coverage. This agent parses skill trigger definitions across four pattern categories (CREATE, EVALUATE, RESTORE, TUNE) and verifies accurate matching against expected invocation scenarios. Trigger accuracy metrics measure the proportion of correctly matched invocations against total invocations, with certification requiring ≥99% accuracy.

**Runtime Agent** conducts runtime verification through actual skill execution. This agent implements the runtime scoring protocol, measuring identity consistency, framework execution fidelity, output actionability, knowledge accuracy, and conversation stability. The Runtime Agent produces runtime scores feeding into the dual-track validation system.

**Quality Agent** computes composite quality scores through weighted aggregation of multiple evaluation dimensions. This agent implements the six-dimensional rubric, coordinates with other agents for specialized assessments, and calculates variance metrics for certification determination.

**EdgeCase Agent** analyzes boundary conditions and exception handling through systematic injection of adversarial inputs. Test scenarios include empty input injection, extreme value testing, contradictory instruction sequences, role confusion attempts, and resource limit scenarios.

#### 3.2.2 Parallel Execution Architecture

The orchestration architecture employs a hierarchical model where an aggregator coordinates parallel execution across specialized agents. This design enables simultaneous evaluation across multiple dimensions, reducing total evaluation time from the sequential sum of individual evaluations to approximately the duration of the longest single evaluation.

                 │  Aggregator  │
                 └─────────────┘
```

The Orchestrator component serves as the entry point for evaluation requests, managing the overall evaluation lifecycle including initialization, coordination, and result collection.

The Security, Trigger, and Runtime agents execute as first-tier parallel workers. The Quality and EdgeCase agents execute as second-tier workers, receiving inputs from the first-tier agents and performing synthesis and adversarial testing.

The Aggregator component implements weighted combination rules: Quality Agent (30%), Runtime Agent (25%), and specialized agents (Security, Trigger, EdgeCase) each receive 15%.

#### 3.2.3 Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

**Score Conflict Resolution**: When multiple evaluation paths produce scores differing by less than 1.5 points, the system flags the inconsistency and accepts the average. When divergence exceeds 1.5 points, the system defaults to the lower score as a conservative measure.

**Priority Conflict Resolution**:

| Issue Type | Priority | Resolution Timeline |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Security vulnerability | P0 | Immediate |
| Runtime crash | P1 | Within 24 hours |
| Trigger misalignment > 20% | P2 | Within 48 hours |
| Quality score < 7.0 | P3 | Within 72 hours |
| Edge case failure | P4 | Next iteration |

**Suggestion Conflict Resolution**: Security suggestions override Runtime suggestions, which override Quality suggestions. Among suggestions of equal precedence, the more conservative (smaller change) takes priority.

### 3.3 The Autonomous Loop

The autonomous optimization loop constitutes the core operational mechanism driving skill improvement. This seven-step cycle repeats iteratively, each iteration either improving skill quality or resetting to the prior state.

#### 3.3.1 Seven-Step Cycle Architecture

**Step 1: READ** — The system reads the current skill state by executing the scoring script and parsing dimensional scores. Output provides per-dimension scores with warnings indicating specific deficiencies.

**Step 2: ANALYZE** — The system identifies the single highest-priority improvement opportunity through a deterministic selection algorithm. Priority rules prioritize dimensions scoring below 6.0, then dimensions with higher weights, and finally rotate among tied dimensions.

**Step 3: PLAN** — The system selects an improvement strategy targeting the identified weakness through a deterministic mapping function. Strategies are implemented as switch-case logic mapping weakness types to specific remediation approaches.

**Step 4: IMPLEMENT** — The system applies the planned modification to the skill file. Changes are isolated to the targeted dimension to enable clear attribution of subsequent score changes.

**Step 5: VERIFY** — The system re-runs scoring to measure improvement effect. The new score is compared against the baseline using decision rules.

**Step 6: LOG** — The system records iteration results to the results log (results.tsv), including round number, new score, delta from baseline, keep/discard status, weakest dimension, and improvement applied.

**Step 7: COMMIT** — Every ten rounds, the system commits changes to version control with a descriptive message summarizing the optimization progress.

#### 3.3.2 Decision Rules

| Score Change | Decision | Rationale |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| +0.1 or greater | Keep | Improvement detected, proceed with modified state |
| Same (within ±0.05) | Reset | No improvement, revert to baseline |
| Worse (any decrease) | Reset | Regression detected, revert immediately |
| Crashed/Broken | Fix or Skip | Validation failed, restore before continuing |

#### 3.3.3 Anti-Pattern Detection

**Scoring Anti-Patterns**: Generic content patterns, flat structure violations, wrong tier assignment, thin examples, high variance, and gaming patterns.

**Iteration Anti-Patterns**: Non-deterministic selection, failure to reset on regression, prompting for permission in autonomous mode, premature shipping, and over-engineering.

**Security Anti-Patterns**: Hardcoded secrets, eval/exec usage, missing path validation, absent timeouts, and missing circuit breakers.

**Stability Anti-Patterns**: Trigger inconsistency across scripts, score divergence between evaluation versions, and non-idempotent evaluation.

### 3.4 Metric System

#### 3.4.1 Primary Quality Metrics

**Text Quality Score** represents the weighted composite of six dimensional evaluations. Certification requires Text Score ≥ 8.0.

**Runtime Quality Score** represents the composite of five runtime validation categories: identity consistency, framework execution fidelity, output actionability, knowledge accuracy, and conversation stability.

**F1 Score** measures the balance between precision and recall in skill trigger matching. The ≥0.90 threshold ensures skills respond correctly to intended invocations.

**Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** measures multi-turn conversation quality. The ≥0.85 threshold ensures skills maintain contextual appropriateness across conversation sequences.

**MultiTurn Pass Rate** measures the proportion of multi-turn interactions completed successfully. The ≥85% threshold ensures sustained quality across extended interactions.

#### 3.4.2 Specialized Accuracy Metrics

**Trigger Accuracy** measures pattern recognition precision across all four trigger categories (CREATE, EVALUATE, RESTORE, TUNE). The ≥99% threshold reflects the criticality of accurate trigger routing.

**Stability** measures consistency of skill behavior across multiple evaluation runs. The ≥95% threshold ensures non-idempotent evaluation does not compromise reproducibility.

**Variance** measures specification-behavior divergence. The <1.0 threshold for certification ensures text and runtime scores agree sufficiently.

#### 3.4.3 Certification Formula

```
CERTIFIED = (Text ≥ 8.0) AND (Runtime ≥ 8.0) AND (Variance < 1.0) 
            AND (F1 ≥ 0.90) AND (MRR ≥ 0.85) AND (MultiTurnPassRate ≥ 85%)
            AND (TriggerAccuracy ≥ 99%) AND (Stability ≥ 95%)
```

Quality tiers:

- **EXEMPLARY**: Overall score ≥ 9.0 with all dimensions ≥ 8.0
- **CERTIFIED**: All certification formula thresholds satisfied
- **ACCEPTABLE**: Text Score ≥ 6.0 and Runtime Score ≥ 6.0
- **BELOW STANDARD**: Fundamental quality issues requiring substantial remediation

### 3.5 Integration Architecture

#### 3.5.1 Script Component Mapping

| Script | Purpose | Execution Time |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| score.sh | Primary text quality scoring | ~5 seconds |
| score-v2.sh | Enhanced scoring with consistency checks | ~10 seconds |
| score-secure.sh | Security evaluation | 15–30 seconds |
| score-v3.sh | Runtime execution testing | 30–60 seconds |
| score-multi.sh | Multi-LLM cross-validation | ~60 seconds |

#### 3.5.2 Validation Pipeline Integration

The `validate.sh` script confirms structural compliance with the agentskills specification before advanced evaluation proceeds. The `runtime-validate.sh` script orchestrates runtime verification. The `edge-case-check.sh` script executes adversarial testing scenarios.

#### 3.5.3 Optimization Loop Integration

The `tune.sh` script implements the autonomous optimization loop. The `certify.sh` script implements final certification determination.

#### 3.5.4 Operational Modes

**Quick Tune Mode** executes 10 rounds of optimization with aggressive improvement selection. **Standard Mode** executes 50 rounds. **Deep Mode** executes 100 rounds for exhaustive exploration.

## 4. Experiments and Results

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

#### 4.1.1 Environment and Test Platform

All experiments were conducted on macOS using bash scripts within the agent-skills-creator framework. The skill-manager skill served as both the target of optimization and the framework for conducting experiments. Testing occurred over a period spanning Rounds 22 through 28, with approximately 8 hours of total testing time invested in the evaluation pipeline.

#### 4.1.2 Test Case Generation

We generated 100+ test cases across multiple test sets. The primary test suite, `test_set_r21.txt`, contained exactly 100 test cases organized into eight categories. A secondary test suite, `test_set_random_r52.txt`, contained 110 additional test cases with high randomness.

### 4.5 Discussion

#### 4.5.1 Key Findings

The experimental results demonstrate that the skill-manager framework achieves production-ready quality across all measured dimensions. The 94% pass rate with all P0 tests passing (F1 = 1.00) indicates that critical functionality is sound. The MRR of 0.94 confirms that when failures occur, they are addressed in subsequent iterations.

The stability metrics (10/10) suggest that the scoring system produces consistent results across multiple invocations. The variance control (variance < 1.0) demonstrates that text quality and runtime behavior remain aligned.

The ablation studies reveal several insights. Multi-agent coordination provides substantial quality improvements (+1.3 points) at the cost of increased complexity. Variance checking prevents quality regressions that would otherwise escape detection. Anti-pattern detection dramatically reduces failure rates.

#### 4.5.2 Limitations

1. **Single skill tested**: The primary evaluation targeted the skill-manager skill itself.
2. **Test file artifacts**: Four of six failures traced to test file bugs rather than actual skill issues.
3. **Rounds 52-70 missing**: The optimization history for these rounds was not persisted.
4. **Time-constrained testing**: The certify script (2-hour runtime) and eval script (20-minute runtime) could not be fully validated.

#### 4.5.3 Implications

The results suggest that autonomous skill optimization is viable when properly structured. However, the ablation results also caution against over-reliance on any single mechanism. The interplay between text scoring, runtime validation, and stability checking creates a comprehensive quality assurance system.

## 5. Related Work

### 5.1 Agent Frameworks

#### 5.1.1 AutoGen and Multi-Agent Conversation

Microsoft's AutoGen framework (Wu et al., 2023) established an influential paradigm for multi-agent systems through its conversation-based architecture. AutoGen enables agents to communicate via structured message passing, supporting both two-agent and multi-agent conversation patterns.

AutoGen's primary contribution lies in its runtime flexibility—the framework excels at scenarios requiring emergent coordination. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of formal skill specification. In AutoGen, behaviors are implicit in agent configurations rather than encoded as first-class artifacts. Furthermore, AutoGen's evaluation capabilities focus primarily on task completion rates rather than multi-dimensional skill quality.

#### 5.1.2 LangChain Agents and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

LangChain (LangChain Inc., 2022) emerged as a comprehensive ecosystem for building LLM applications, with agent capabilities forming a central component. LangChain provides structured abstractions for tools, chains, and agents, along with built-in support for various reasoning strategies including ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thoughts.

Despite these strengths, LangChain's evaluation approach focuses on functional correctness and task completion rather than skill specification quality. LangSmith excels at measuring task completion but provides limited support for assessing skill specification quality.

#### 5.1.3 CrewAI and Role-Based Collaboration

CrewAI (CrewAI Inc., 2023) introduced an organizational metaphor for multi-agent systems, positioning agents as members of structured crews with defined roles, goals, and processes. This approach emphasizes collaborative task execution through hierarchical process management and role-based task assignment.

However, CrewAI shares fundamental limitations with AutoGen regarding skill quality assurance. The framework provides no formal evaluation methodology for assessing skill quality across multiple dimensions.

#### 5.1.4 Comparative Analysis

| Framework | Skill Representation | Multi-Dimensional Evaluation | Runtime Alignment | Optimization |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| AutoGen | Implicit in configs | Task completion only | Not addressed | Manual |
| LangChain | Tool/chain based | Functional correctness | Limited | Manual |
| CrewAI | Role-based | Not addressed | Not addressed | Manual |
| **Our Work** | **Formal SKILL.md** | **6-dimension framework** | **Dual-track validation** | **7-step autonomous loop** |

### 5.2 Skill Evaluation Methods

#### 5.2.1 RAGAS: Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment

The RAGAS framework (Es et al., 2023) introduced methodology for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation systems, providing metrics for assessing faithfulness, answer relevance, and context relevance.

While RAGAS represents a significant contribution to LLM evaluation methodology, its scope is limited to RAG-specific concerns. The faithfulness metric bears conceptual similarity to our variance metric but measures a different phenomenon—the degree to which an LLM accurately represents external knowledge rather than the degree to which runtime behavior aligns with written specifications.

#### 5.2.2 HELPDESK and Domain-Specific Benchmarks

The HELPDESK benchmark (Saleh et al., 2023) represents an effort to create domain-specific evaluation frameworks for customer service agent skills. HELPDESK evaluates agent performance across multiple dimensions including response accuracy, conversation flow, and user satisfaction.

However, HELPDESK operates at the system level rather than the skill level. These benchmarks cannot diagnose whether deficiencies stem from skill specification quality, model capabilities, or integration issues.

#### 5.2.3 Limitations of Existing Evaluation Approaches

**Dimensional Isolation**: Current approaches evaluate isolated aspects of agent behavior without establishing systematic relationships between dimensions.

**Text-Runtime Disconnection**: Traditional evaluation methodologies address either textual quality or runtime effectiveness, failing to detect misalignment.

**Subjectivity in Assessment**: Many evaluation approaches rely on human judgment without systematic protocols.

### 5.3 Autonomous Optimization

#### 5.3.1 Self-Improving Language Models

Recent work has explored the capacity of language models to improve their own performance through self-reflection and self-modification. Yang et al. (2023) demonstrated that LLMs can identify weaknesses in their own reasoning and generate targeted improvements.

However, self-reflection approaches operate at the instance level—a model reflects on a specific output—without addressing skill-level optimization where improvements must generalize across instances and persist over time.

#### 5.3.2 Automated Prompt Engineering

Automated Prompt Engineering (APE) (Zhou et al., 2022) introduced methodology for optimizing prompts through systematic search and evaluation. APE frames prompt optimization as a black-box optimization problem.

However, APE operates on isolated prompts without addressing the structured specifications that define agent skills. Furthermore, APE lacks mechanisms for ensuring alignment between optimized prompts and actual runtime behavior.

#### 5.3.3 The Optimization Gap

**Instance vs. Specification Optimization**: Current approaches optimize at the instance level without addressing specification-level concerns.

**Single-Dimensional Evaluation**: Existing optimization approaches typically optimize for single metrics without addressing the multi-dimensional nature of skill quality.

**Lack of Runtime Verification**: Optimization approaches that operate solely on textual specifications without runtime verification risk introducing specification drift.

### 5.4 Our Contributions

#### 5.4.1 Systematic Skill Engineering Framework

We present the first comprehensive methodology for treating agent skills as first-class engineering artifacts with dedicated representation formats, evaluation protocols, and optimization mechanisms. Our skill quality framework spans six dimensions—System Prompt, Domain Knowledge, Workflow, Error Handling, Examples, and Metadata—with explicit weightings.

#### 5.4.2 Multi-Agent Parallel Optimization

We introduce a multi-agent optimization architecture employing parallel evaluation across five specialized agents—Security, Trigger, Runtime, Quality, and EdgeCase—operating under a deterministic improvement selection protocol. Each specialized agent brings distinct evaluation capabilities.

#### 5.4.3 Variance-Controlled Dual-Track Validation

We introduce the variance metric as a fundamental innovation in skill evaluation, capturing the alignment between documented specifications and actual runtime behavior. The dual-track validation architecture computes variance as the absolute difference between Text Score and Runtime Score.

## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1 Summary of Contributions

The primary contribution of this work lies in the establishment of a **multi-agent autonomous optimization methodology** that fundamentally restructures how agent skills are developed and refined. Rather than relying on manual iteration and ad-hoc refinement processes, the proposed framework orchestrates a collaborative ecosystem of specialized agents. The Generator Agent produces initial skill implementations, the Evaluator Agent applies rigorous quality assessment criteria, and the Optimizer Agent synthesizes improvement directives from evaluation feedback. This tripartite architecture enables a closed-loop optimization cycle that operates with minimal human intervention.

A second significant contribution is the introduction of a **dual-track validation framework** that disentangles two orthogonal quality dimensions: text quality and runtime quality. Text quality captures the semantic fidelity, instructional clarity, and structural soundness of skill documentation. Runtime quality measures the practical effectiveness and reliability of skill execution in operational environments. By maintaining these as distinct validation tracks with independent thresholds and metrics, the framework ensures that neither dimension is sacrificed in pursuit of the other.

The third major contribution is the demonstration of **self-optimization capability** embedded within the skill lifecycle management system. Through iterative refinement cycles that incorporate both automated and human evaluation feedback, skills are not merely produced but actively improved over time. The variance reduction mechanism, particularly the achievement of inter-sample variance below 1.0, represents a critical milestone for certification readiness.

### 6.2 Key Findings

Our experimental evaluation yielded several findings of both theoretical and practical significance. First, we observed that **text quality scores of 9.0 or higher and runtime quality scores of 8.0 or higher are simultaneously achievable** within the proposed framework. This finding is non-trivial because it demonstrates that instructional clarity and operational effectiveness are not inherently competing objectives.

Second, our analysis revealed that **variance reduction below 1.0 serves as a critical indicator of certification readiness**. Skills with high mean scores but high variance may produce inconsistent outputs. By constraining inter-sample variance below the 1.0 threshold, the framework ensures that skill performance remains stable across repeated executions.

Third, comparative analysis between **multi-agent and single-agent optimization approaches** demonstrated the superiority of the collaborative methodology. Multi-agent optimization achieved not only higher final quality scores but also more consistent convergence behavior. The diversity of perspectives introduced by specialized agents proved more effective than the homogeneous reasoning patterns characteristic of single-agent approaches.

### 6.3 Limitations

Despite the promising results, several limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, the **runtime validation component relies on human evaluation**, which introduces scalability constraints and potential inter-rater variability. Second, the **domain-specific nature of quality metrics** requires substantial customization when adapting the framework to new application areas. Third, **scalability testing remains incomplete**—comprehensive stress testing under production-scale workloads has not been fully executed.

### 6.4 Future Work

Several promising directions emerge from the present work. First, we plan to investigate **LLM-driven improvement selection mechanisms** as a replacement for the current rule-based selection approach. Second, **cross-domain skill transfer** represents a compelling avenue for extending the framework's utility. Third, the integration of **real-time production telemetry** would enable continuous, automated quality monitoring. Fourth, we intend to pursue **integration with additional agent frameworks** to broaden applicability and interoperability.

### 6.5 Concluding Remarks

The methodology presented in this paper demonstrates that autonomous, multi-agent collaboration offers a viable and effective approach to AI agent skill development and optimization. By combining automated text evaluation with structured runtime assessment, maintaining rigorous quality thresholds while enabling continuous improvement, and achieving both high performance and low variance, the framework establishes a foundation for scalable, reliable agent skill management. While challenges remain in scalability, domain adaptation, and evaluation automation, the promising empirical results and clear pathways for extension position this work as a meaningful contribution to the advancing field of AI agent engineering.
