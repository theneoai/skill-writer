# Skill Writer

> **Type**: Meta-Skill  
> **Platform**: Claude  
> **Version**: 1.0.0

A meta-skill that enables Claude to create, evaluate, and optimize other skills through natural language interaction.

---

## Overview

Skill Writer provides three powerful modes:

- **CREATE**: Generate new skills from scratch using structured templates
- **EVALUATE**: Assess skill quality with 1000-point scoring and certification
- **OPTIMIZE**: Continuously improve skills through iterative refinement

### Key Features

- **Zero CLI**: Natural language interface - no commands to memorize
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on OpenCode, OpenClaw, Claude, Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini
- **Template-Based**: 4 built-in templates for common skill patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated evaluation with certification tiers
- **Security Built-In**: CWE-based security pattern detection

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Copy to Claude skills directory
cp skill-writer-claude.md ~/.claude/skills/

# Or use Claude's skill management
```

### Usage Examples

**Create a new skill:**
```
"Create a weather API skill that fetches current conditions"
```

**Evaluate an existing skill:**
```
"Evaluate this skill and give me a quality score"
```

**Optimize a skill:**
```
"Optimize this skill to make it more concise"
```

## CREATE Mode

### 7-Step Workflow

1. **Parse Request**: Analyze intent and extract requirements
2. **Select Template**: Choose from 4 built-in templates
3. **Elicit Requirements**: Ask clarifying questions
4. **Generate Output**: Create skill using template
5. **Security Scan**: Check for CWE vulnerabilities
6. **Quality Check**: Validate structure and completeness
7. **Deliver**: Output final skill file

### Available Templates

**Base Template**: Generic skill structure
- Use for: Simple skills, proof of concepts
- Features: Standard sections, minimal boilerplate

**API Integration**: Skills for external APIs
- Use for: REST API clients, webhooks, integrations
- Features: Endpoint handling, authentication patterns

**Data Pipeline**: Data processing skills
- Use for: ETL, data transformation, analysis
- Features: Input validation, processing steps, output formatting

**Workflow Automation**: Task automation skills
- Use for: CI/CD, repetitive tasks, orchestration
- Features: Step sequencing, error recovery, notifications

### Elicitation Questions

When creating a skill, Claude will ask:

1. **Purpose**: What is the primary goal?
2. **Audience**: Who are the target users?
3. **Features**: What capabilities must it have?
4. **Constraints**: Any standards or requirements?
5. **Scale**: Expected usage volume?
6. **References**: Examples to emulate or avoid?

---

## EVALUATE Mode

### 4-Phase Evaluation Pipeline

1. **Structural Analysis**: Check format, sections, completeness
2. **Content Quality**: Assess clarity, examples, instructions
3. **Security Audit**: Scan for CWE patterns
4. **Scoring**: Calculate 1000-point score

### Scoring Rubric (1000 Points Total)

**Phase 1: Parse & Validate (100 points)**
- YAML syntax valid
- Required fields present (name, version, interface, description, author)
- Semantic versioning format

**Phase 2: Text Quality (300 points)**
- Clarity (50 pts): Instructions clear, no ambiguity
- Completeness (50 pts): All required sections present
- Accuracy (60 pts): Examples correct and runnable
- Safety (60 pts): Red Lines / 严禁 present
- Maintainability (40 pts): Well structured, version controlled
- Usability (40 pts): Trigger phrases clear, examples adequate

**Phase 3: Runtime Testing (400 points)**
- Each mode tested against sample inputs
- Quality gates validated
- Security scan (CWE-798/89/78/22) passed

**Phase 4: Certification (200 points)**
- LEAN re-check post-evaluation
- Variance check: |Phase2/3 − Phase3/4| within tier limit
- UTE injection verified

### Certification Tiers

- **PLATINUM (≥950)**: Exceptional; variance < 10
- **GOLD (≥900)**: Production-ready; variance < 15
- **SILVER (≥800)**: Good quality; variance < 20
- **BRONZE (≥700)**: Acceptable minimum for delivery; variance < 30
- **FAIL (<700)**: Route to OPTIMIZE

## OPTIMIZE Mode

### 7-Dimension Analysis

1. **Conciseness**: Remove redundancy
2. **Clarity**: Improve understanding
3. **Completeness**: Add missing elements
4. **Security**: Fix vulnerabilities
5. **Performance**: Optimize execution
6. **Maintainability**: Improve structure
7. **Usability**: Enhance user experience

### 9-Step Optimization Loop

1. **Parse**: Understand current skill
2. **Analyze**: Identify improvement areas
3. **Generate**: Create optimized version
4. **Evaluate**: Score the new version
5. **Compare**: Check against previous
6. **Converge**: Detect improvement plateau
7. **Validate**: Ensure correctness
8. **Report**: Show changes
9. **Iterate**: Repeat if needed

### Convergence Detection

Optimization stops when:
- Score improvement < 0.5 points (delta_threshold)
- Plateau detected: no gain in last 10 iterations (window_size)
- User requests stop
- Maximum iterations reached (20)

Automatically checks for:
- **CWE-78**: OS Command Injection
- **CWE-79**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **CWE-89**: SQL Injection
