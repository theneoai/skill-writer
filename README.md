⚠️ Cursor: IDE command palette intercepts `/` — use keyword phrases instead:

| Mode | Use this keyword phrase (not `/command`) |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| CREATE | `create a skill that …` |
| LEAN | `lean eval` / `fast check this skill` |
| EVALUATE | `evaluate this skill` / `full eval` |
| OPTIMIZE | `optimize this skill` |
| INSTALL | `install skill-writer to cursor` |
| COLLECT | `collect session data` / `record this session` |

## Quick Start

### What You Get After Installing

| Features | curl install `[CORE]` | git clone install `[EXTENDED]` |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| All 6 modes (CREATE, LEAN, EVALUATE, OPTIMIZE, INSTALL, COLLECT) | ✅ | ✅ |
| LEAN & EVALUATE scoring | ✅ | ✅ (richer detail reports) |
| OPTIMIZE loop | ✅ | ✅ |
| COLLECT manual (JSON output to conversation) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Companion files (refs/, templates/, eval/) for Claude | ❌ | ✅ |
| COLLECT auto-persist to `~/.skill-artifacts/` | ❌ | ✅ (requires hooks) |

### LEAN Mode

Fast 500-point evaluator for rapid quality assessment. Checks are labeled by execution method:
- **`[STATIC]`** — deterministic regex/structural match; same skill → same result every run (335 pts max, zero variance)
- **`[HEURISTIC]`** — requires LLM judgment to assess adequacy (165 pts max, ±5–15 pts variance)

#### 17-Check Rubric (organized by dimension)

| Dimension | Check | Points | Type |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| **System Design** (max 95) | Identity section present (`## §1` or `## Identity`) | 55 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Red Lines / 严禁 text present | 40 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Domain Knowledge** (max 95) | Template type correctly matched (API/pipeline/workflow keywords) | 55 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| | Field specificity visible (concrete values, not generic placeholders) | 40 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| **Workflow** (max 75) | ≥ 3 `## §N` pattern sections | 45 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Quality Gates table with numeric thresholds | 30 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Error Handling** (max 75) | Error/recovery section present | 45 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Escalation paths documented (HUMAN_REVIEW path present) | 30 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| **Examples** (max 75) | ≥ 2 fenced code blocks | 45 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Trigger keywords present in both EN + ZH | 30 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Security** (max 45) | Security Baseline section present | 25 | `[STATIC]` |
| | No hardcoded secrets pattern | 10 | `[STATIC]` |
| | ASI01: no unguarded `{user_input}` interpolation in commands | 10 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| **Metadata** (max 40) | YAML frontmatter with `name`, `version`, `interface` | 15 | `[STATIC]` |
| | `triggers` field with ≥ 3 EN + ≥ 2 ZH phrases | 15 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Negative Boundaries section present | 10 | `[STATIC]` |

#### Score Proxies and Decision Gates

| LEAN Score | Proxy | Decision |
|------------|-------|----------|
| ≥ 475 | PLATINUM proxy (est. ≥ 950) | LEAN PASS — deliver with `LEAN_CERT` |
| ≥ 450 | GOLD proxy (est. ≥ 900) | LEAN PASS |
| ≥ 400 | SILVER proxy (est. ≥ 800) | LEAN PASS |
| ≥ 350 | BRONZE proxy (est. ≥ 700) | LEAN PASS |
| 300–349 | UNCERTAIN | Escalate to full EVALUATE |
| < 300 | FAIL | Route to OPTIMIZE |

> **Score reliability**: If two LEAN runs differ by ≤ 20 pts, treat them as equivalent.
> Static-only floor (335 pts) means any well-structured skill will clear the PASS threshold on `[STATIC]` checks alone.

#### Triggers
- "lean evaluate" / "快评"
- "quick check" / "快速检查"
- "rapid eval" / "快速评估"

### EVALUATE Mode

Assesses skill quality with rigorous 1000-point scoring and certification.

#### 4-Phase Pipeline

| Phase | Points | Focus | Variance |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Phase 1: Structural | 100 | YAML syntax, format, metadata | ±0–5 pts |
| Phase 2: Content Quality | 300 | Clarity, completeness, accuracy, safety, maintainability, usability | ±15–30 pts |
| Phase 3: Runtime Tests | 400 | Unit, integration, sandbox, error handling, performance, security tests | ±20–40 pts |
| Phase 4: Certification | 200 | Documentation, coverage, quality, compatibility, review | ±5–10 pts |

> **Total score variance**: ±30–60 pts across runs. Re-run if the score falls in a confidence zone (see below).

#### Tier-Adjusted Phase 2 Weights

Phase 2 weights shift based on `skill_tier` in YAML frontmatter:

| Dimension | `planning` | `functional` (default) | `atomic` |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| System Design | **30%** | 20% | 15% |
| Workflow | **25%** | 20% | 15% |
| Error Handling | 15% | 15% | **25%** |
| Examples | 10% | 15% | **20%** |
| Security | 10% | 15% | **15%** |

#### Certification Tiers

| Tier | Score | Confidence Zone (re-run) | Phase 2 Min | Phase 3 Min |
|------|-------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **PLATINUM** | ≥950 | 940–959 | ≥270 | ≥360 |
| **GOLD** | ≥900 | 890–919 | ≥255 | ≥340 |
| **SILVER** | ≥800 | 790–819 | ≥225 | ≥300 |
| **BRONZE** | ≥700 | 690–719 | ≥195 | ≥265 |
| **FAIL** | <700 | — | — | — |

> **Confidence zone**: Scores within ±10 pts of a tier boundary may flip on re-run. Run twice and take the lower score.

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- "evaluate this skill" / "评测这个技能"
- "check the quality" / "检查质量"
- "certify my skill" / "认证我的技能"
- "score this skill" / "评分"
- "assess this skill" / "评估这个技能"

### OPTIMIZE Mode

Continuously improves skills through iterative refinement with 7-dimension analysis.

#### 7-Dimension Analysis

| Dimension | Weight | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| System Design | 20% | Architecture, workflow structure |
| Domain Knowledge | 20% | Accuracy, terminology, context |
| Workflow Definition | 20% | Step clarity, transitions |
| Error Handling | 15% | Edge cases, recovery |
| Examples | 15% | Coverage, relevance |
| Metadata | 10% | Documentation, tags |
| Long-Context | 10% | Token efficiency, structure |

#### 10-Step Optimization Loop
1. **Parse**: Understand current skill and read `skill_tier` for weight selection
2. **Analyze**: Identify improvement areas across 7 dimensions (tier-adjusted weights)
3. **Generate**: Create optimized version
4. **Evaluate**: Score the new version (LEAN 500-pt scale)
5. **Compare**: Check against previous
6. **RE-SCORE**: Re-score after each single fix
7. **Converge**: Detect improvement plateau
8. **Report**: Show changes and dimension breakdown
9. **Iterate**: Repeat if needed (max 20 rounds)
10. **VERIFY**: Co-evolutionary independent re-evaluation after convergence — score inflation delta > 50 pts → HUMAN_REVIEW

> **Tier-aware strategy** (from `optimize/strategies.md §6`):
> - `planning` skills: prioritize Workflow (25%) → System Design (30%) first
> - `atomic` skills: prioritize Error Handling (25%) → Examples (20%) first
> - `functional` skills: target lowest-scoring dimension first (default)

#### Convergence Detection
Optimization stops when:
- Score improvement < 0.5 points
- 10 iterations without significant gain (plateau window)
- User requests stop
- Maximum iterations reached (20)
- DIVERGING detected → HALT → HUMAN_REVIEW

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- "optimize this skill" / "优化这个技能"
- "improve my skill" / "改进我的技能"
- "make this skill better" / "让这个技能更好"
- "refine this skill" / "精炼这个技能"
- "enhance this skill" / "增强这个技能"

### INSTALL Mode

Installs skill-writer itself to one or all supported platforms from a URL or local clone.

#### Workflow
1. **PARSE_INPUT**: Extract URL and target platform(s) from user message
2. **FETCH**: If URL provided, download and verify the file
3. **CONFIRM**: Show install plan, ask user to confirm
4. **INSTALL**: Write skill file to each platform's skills directory
5. **REPORT**: List installed paths and next steps

#### Platform Paths

| Platform | Skills Directory | Format |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Claude | `~/.claude/skills/` | Markdown |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | Markdown |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | Markdown |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` | Markdown |
| Gemini | `~/.gemini/skills/` | Markdown |
| OpenAI | `~/.openai/skills/` | JSON |
| MCP | `~/.mcp/servers/skill-writer/` | JSON manifest |

### COLLECT Mode

COLLECT records a structured **Session Artifact** after each skill invocation — a snapshot of what happened, how well it worked, and what to improve. Accumulate 2+ artifacts, then run AGGREGATE to get a ranked improvement list for `/opt`.

**[CORE]** — COLLECT outputs JSON to the conversation. Copy it to a file manually.  
**[EXTENDED]** — With UTE hooks configured, COLLECT auto-writes to `~/.skill-artifacts/` after each invocation. No manual step needed.

#### When to run COLLECT
- After an important or representative skill invocation
- When a trigger phrase didn't match (helps identify missing keywords)
- Before running OPTIMIZE (feed artifacts as input for evidence-based improvement)

#### Workflow
1. **CAPTURE**: Record invocation context, outcome, and PRM signal
2. **CLASSIFY**: Assign lesson type (`strategic_pattern` / `failure_lesson` / `neutral`)
3. **STORE**: Output JSON artifact `[CORE]` or auto-write to `~/.skill-artifacts/` `[EXTENDED]`
4. **AGGREGATE** (after 2+ artifacts): Distill artifacts into ranked improvement signals → OPTIMIZE candidates

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- `/collect` or `collect session data` / `收集本次会话` — manual trigger
- `record session artifact` / `记录会话数据`
- `export invocation log` / `导出调用日志`
- Auto-triggered by UTE after each invocation `[EXTENDED]`

#### AGGREGATE (multi-session synthesis)
After collecting 2+ Session Artifacts, type:
- `"aggregate skill feedback"` / `"聚合技能反馈"`

AGGREGATE groups findings by skill dimension, identifies the "no-skill bucket" (sessions where no skill triggered), and ranks improvement opportunities by evidence count. Output feeds directly into `/opt`.

## UTE (Use-to-Evolve)

Self-improvement protocol that enables skills to evolve through usage. Two-tier architecture:
- **L1 (Single-user)** `[CORE]`: Post-invocation hook runs per session; persists state to `~/.claude/skills/.ute-state/`
- **L2 (Collective)** `[EXTENDED]`: Requires external aggregation infrastructure (SkillClaw-compatible). See `refs/use-to-evolve.md §10`.

### UTE YAML Block

```yaml
use_to_evolve:
  enabled: true
  injected_by: "skill-writer v3.1.0"
  injected_at: "2026-04-11"
  check_cadence: {lightweight: 10, full_recompute: 50, tier_drift: 100}
  micro_patch_enabled: true
  feedback_detection: true
  certified_lean_score: 390
  last_ute_check: null
  pending_patches: 0
  total_micro_patches_applied: 0
  cumulative_invocations: 0
```

### Cadence-Gated Health Checks

| Cadence | Trigger | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Every 10 invocations | Lightweight check | rolling_success_rate < 0.80 → warn |
| Every 50 invocations | Full metric recompute | F1 < 0.90 → queue OPTIMIZE |
| Every 100 invocations | Tier drift check | estimated_lean < (certified − 50) → full EVALUATE |

### Micro-Patch Rules

**Eligible** (apply autonomously after LEAN validation):
- Add trigger keyword (YAML + mode section)
- Add ZH trigger equivalent
- Bump patch version + update `updated` date

**Ineligible** (must queue for OPTIMIZE):
- Structural section changes, output contract changes, security baseline changes

### Platform Hook Integration (Claude Code / OpenCode)

UTE state tracking upgrades from `[EXTENDED]` to `[CORE]` when platform hooks are configured:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{"command": "node ~/.claude/skills/ute-tracker.js post-tool"}],
    "Stop": [{"command": "node ~/.claude/skills/ute-tracker.js stop"}]
  }
}
```

See `refs/use-to-evolve.md §8` for full hook setup and `ute-tracker.js` implementation.

## Builder Tool

The `skill-writer-builder` CLI tool generates platform-specific skills from the core engine.

### Installation

```bash
cd builder
npm install
```

### Commands

> **Note**: Pre-built platform files in `platforms/` are committed as distribution assets — no build step is required for installation. Run `npm run build` only when you modify `skill-framework.md` or `refs/` to regenerate them. In CI, lint and tests run without `|| true` and will fail the pipeline on errors.

#### Build
```bash
# Build for all platforms
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js build --platform all --output ./platforms

# Build for specific platform
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js build --platform opencode --output ./platforms

# Release build
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js build --platform all --release
```

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Watch for changes and auto-rebuild
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js dev --platform opencode
```

#### Validate
```bash
# Validate core engine structure
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js validate
```

#### Inspect
```bash
# Inspect built skill
node bin/skill-writer-builder.js inspect --platform opencode
```

## Example Skills

All example skills are certified with detailed evaluation reports.

| Skill | Type | Tier | Score | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------|-------------|
| [api-tester](examples/api-tester/) | API Integration | 🥇 GOLD | 920/1000 | HTTP API testing automation |
| [code-reviewer](examples/code-reviewer/) | Workflow Automation | 🥇 GOLD | 947/1000 | Code review with security scanning |
| [doc-generator](examples/doc-generator/) | Data Pipeline | 🥇 GOLD | 895/1000 | Documentation generation |

**Average Score: 920.7/1000**

## Contributing

### Adding New Templates

1. Create template in `templates/`
2. Add metadata header with placeholders
3. Include placeholder documentation
4. Test with CREATE mode
5. Update documentation

### Adding Platform Support

1. Create adapter in `builder/src/platforms/`
2. Implement required functions:
   - `formatSkill()`
   - `getInstallPath()`
   - `generateMetadata()`
   - `validateSkill()`
3. Add to platform registry in `index.js`
4. Create platform template in `builder/templates/`
5. Test build command
6. Update documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Skill not triggering
- **Solution**: Verify `triggers` field in YAML frontmatter has ≥ 3 EN + ≥ 2 ZH phrases. Add synonyms for common user phrasings (see anti-pattern A1).

**Issue**: Low LEAN score despite good content
- **Solution**: Check if `skill_tier` is declared — missing `skill_tier` silently defaults to `functional` and may apply wrong weights. Also verify Negative Boundaries section is present (10 pts in metadata dimension).

**Issue**: Score jumps between evaluation runs
- **Solution**: Phase 2 and 3 variance is ±15–40 pts per run. Scores within ±20 pts of each other are equivalent. Use LEAN as the primary iteration signal; run full EVALUATE only for certification.

**Issue**: EVALUATE score near a tier boundary
- **Solution**: Re-run once. If scores differ by < 20 pts, take the lower value. See the "Confidence Zone" column in the Certification Tiers table.

**Issue**: Security warnings
- **Solution**: P0 violations (CWE-798, CWE-89) trigger ABORT — fix before continuing. P1 (ASI01–ASI04) deduct 50 pts. See Security Features section.

**Issue**: Build fails
- **Solution**: Run `validate` command to check core engine structure. Ensure `npm ci` completes without errors before building.
