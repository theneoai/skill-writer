## Abstract

The proliferation of large language model (LLM)-based agents has created an urgent need for systematic engineering approaches to AI skill development. Unlike traditional software, agent skills encompass complex behavioral specifications that must exhibit consistent performance across diverse execution contexts.

This repository presents **Agent Skill Engineering**, a comprehensive methodology for managing the complete lifecycle of AI agent skills, from initial specification through autonomous optimization to production certification. Our approach addresses four fundamental challenges: (1) the lack of standardized skill representation formats, (2) the absence of reliable evaluation frameworks capturing both textual quality and runtime effectiveness, (3) the need for autonomous optimization mechanisms, and (4) the critical capability to handle long-context documents.

We introduce a **multi-agent optimization architecture** employing parallel evaluation across specialized agents—Security, Trigger, Runtime, Quality, and EdgeCase—operating under a deterministic improvement selection protocol. Our **9-step autonomous loop** achieves continuous skill improvement with measurable quality targets.

**Key Metrics**: Text Score ≥ 9.5, Runtime Score ≥ 9.5, Variance < 1.0, Mode Detection ≥ 95%

## Key Features

- **9-Step Autonomous Optimization Loop**: READ → ANALYZE → CURATION → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → HUMAN_REVIEW → LOG → COMMIT
- **Dual-Track Validation**: Text quality scoring + Runtime effectiveness testing
- **Multi-Agent Parallel Evaluation**: Security, Trigger, Runtime, Quality, EdgeCase agents
- **Trace Compliance Analysis**: Behavioral rule extraction (AgentPex methodology)
- **Long-Context Handling**: Chunking, RAG, cross-reference preservation (100K+ tokens)
- **Human-Agent Collaboration**: Expert review integration for skills below 8.0 after 10 rounds
- **4-Tier Certification System**:
