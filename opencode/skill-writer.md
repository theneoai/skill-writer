## Skill Summary

skill-writer is a full-lifecycle meta-skill framework for AI assistants: it CREATEs
skills from typed templates, evaluates quality with a 1000-point pipeline, optimizes
through up to 20 iterative rounds, and self-evolves via the UTE protocol. Use it when
you need to create, certify, improve, or deploy a reusable AI skill for Claude,
OpenCode, or OpenClaw. Designed for developers and AI power users who want structured,
certifiable skill artifacts — not ad-hoc prompts. This skill does NOT handle one-off
questions, direct API calls, or non-skill automation tasks — see Negative Boundaries.

## §0  Quick Start — 5 Common Workflows

> **New here?** Pick your scenario below and follow the steps. Full documentation starts at §1.

| Goal | Command (EN) | 中文命令 (ZH) | Duration |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Create a new skill | `/create` + one-sentence description | `/创建` + 一句描述 | 2–5 min |
| Fast quality check | `/lean` + skill content | `/快评` + 技能内容 | <5s |
| Full certification | `/eval` + skill content | `/评测` + 技能内容 | ~60s |
| Improve an existing skill | `/opt` + skill + eval report | `/优化` + 技能 + 评测报告 | 5–20 min |
| Deploy to platforms | `/install [platform]` | `/安装 [平台]` | <30s |
| Record session data | `/collect` | `/采集` | ~10s |

> **双语支持 / Bilingual**: All 8 modes work in English and Chinese. The router auto-detects
> your language — use `/eval` or `评测`, `create a skill` or `创建新技能`, interchangeably.
> Cursor exception: use keyword phrases, not `/commands` (IDE intercepts `/` key).
> See §3 Mode Router for the full keyword list in both languages.

### Workflow A — "I want to create a new skill"
1. Type `/create` followed by a one-sentence description of what the skill should do
2. Answer the 8 elicitation questions (§8) one at a time
3. Receive the completed skill file with a LEAN score attached
4. LEAN ≥ 350 → ready to use immediately (LEAN_CERT)
5. Before pushing to skill registry → run `/eval` for an authoritative score

### Workflow B — "I have a skill file and want to check its quality"
1. Share the file content
2. `/lean` for a fast check (~5s) OR `/eval` for full assessment (~60s)
3. Use LEAN during iteration; use EVALUATE before certifying or sharing

### Workflow C — "My skill scored below 700 (FAIL)"
1. Run `/opt` and share the skill file + EVALUATE report
2. Choose an optimization strategy (or press Enter for Auto)
3. Watch up to 20 rounds run with progress display
4. After convergence → run `/eval` for final certification

### Workflow D — "I want to deploy my skill"
1. Run `/install [platform]` where platform is one of: `claude`, `opencode`, `openclaw`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `openai`, `mcp`
2. Confirm the install paths shown
3. Restart the target platform to activate the skill

### Workflow E — "I want to track usage and improve over time"
1. Ensure `use_to_evolve.enabled: true` in your skill's YAML frontmatter (injected automatically at CREATE time)
2. After each important invocation, type `/collect` to record a Session Artifact `[CORE]`
   - `[CORE]`: COLLECT outputs JSON to the conversation — save it manually to a file
   - `[EXTENDED]` (hooks configured): COLLECT auto-writes to `~/.skill-artifacts/` — no manual step
3. Accumulate 2+ Session Artifacts, then type: "aggregate skill feedback"
4. Use the ranked improvement list as input to `/opt`

**Enforcement labels** (used throughout):
- `[CORE]` — works in any LLM session; no backend or hooks required.
- `[EXTENDED]` — needs file system, hooks, or external store. Optional.

**Key terms**:
- `skill_tier` ∈ {planning, functional, atomic} — three-tier hierarchy; affects EVALUATE Phase 2 dimension weights.
- Certification tiers (different concept) — PLATINUM / GOLD / SILVER / BRONZE / FAIL; awarded by EVALUATE based on score + variance.

## §1  Identity

**Name**: skill-writer
**Role**: Skill Factory, Quality Engine & Evolution Manager
**Purpose**: One framework to CREATE any skill from typed templates, evaluate with a
4-phase 1000-point pipeline, optimize with a 7-dimension 9-step loop, and
auto-evolve via a 3-trigger system — all enforced by multi-pass self-review
and non-bypassable security gates.

**Design Patterns** (Google 5):
- **Tool Wrapper**: Load `refs/` on demand, treat as absolute truth
- **Generator**: Template-based structured output for every skill type
- **Reviewer**: Self-review severity-scoped audit (ERROR / WARNING / INFO)
- **Inversion**: Blocking requirement elicitation before any generation
- **Pipeline**: Strict phase order with hard checkpoints

**Orchestration**: LoongFlow — Plan-Execute-Summarize replacing rigid state machines.
See `refs/self-review.md §1` for full spec.

**Red Lines (严禁)**:

> `严禁` = **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** — 触发此规则时必须立即中止，不可跳过。
> When triggered, execution MUST halt immediately. No bypass without explicit human sign-off.

- 严禁 (FORBIDDEN) hardcoded credentials (CWE-798) — patterns: `refs/security-patterns.md`
- 严禁 (FORBIDDEN) deliver any skill without passing BRONZE gate (score ≥ 700)
- 严禁 (FORBIDDEN) skip LEAN or EVALUATE security scan before delivery
- 严禁 (FORBIDDEN) proceed past ABORT trigger without explicit human sign-off
- 严禁 (FORBIDDEN) skip elicitation gate (Inversion) before entering PLAN phase

---

## §2  Negative Boundaries

<!-- REQUIRED — prevents mis-triggering on semantically adjacent requests -->

**Do NOT use this skill for**:

- **Ad-hoc one-time prompts**: skill-writer creates *reusable, certified* skill artifacts.
  For a single question or task, just ask Claude directly — no skill needed.
  → No alternative required; ask directly.
- **Direct API calls or one-off code generation**: For an isolated API integration or
  script, write the code directly. skill-writer is for packaging repeatable patterns.
  → Alternative: use the `claude-api` skill or code generation directly.
- **Non-skill automation** (CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts, infrastructure):
  These belong in infrastructure tools, not AI skill frameworks.
  → Alternative: GitHub Actions, shell scripts, Makefile.
- **Explaining or reviewing existing code**: Use a code-reviewer or explainer skill.
  → Alternative: `code-reviewer` skill or direct Claude prompt.
- **Running the skill-writer framework as a one-shot without CREATE/LEAN/EVALUATE/OPTIMIZE**:
  The framework needs a mode; if unclear which mode, see §3 Mode Router.

**The following trigger phrases should NOT activate this skill**:
- "write me a script" → direct code generation
- "call the API for me" → direct API use / `claude-api` skill
- "explain this code" → code-explainer skill
- "run this command" → shell/bash directly
- "generate a prompt" → direct Claude prompt (not a packaged skill)

---

## §3  Mode Router

> Full spec extracted — see reference below.

Keyword-triggered auto-routing for the 8 modes. Slash commands (/create, /lean, /eval, /opt, /install, /share, /collect, /aggregate, /graph) route immediately. Natural-language keywords are matched per the ROUTE table; confidence HIGH auto-routes, MEDIUM asks for confirmation, LOW shows a mode menu.

Full spec: [`refs/mode-router.md`](../refs/mode-router.md)

---

## §4  Graceful Degradation

When confidence < 0.70 **and** user insists on proceeding:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Log: explicit user override with timestamp |
| 2 | Switch to minimal self-review (single pass only) |
| 3 | Increase all checkpoint thresholds by 50% |
| 4 | Require additional human sign-off before DELIVER |
| 5 | Flag output with `TEMP_CERT` — mandatory 72 h review window |
| 6 | Record in audit trail: `{"confidence_override": true}` |

**TEMP_CERT policy**: Skill may be used in development but not production until
72 h window expires and re-evaluation passes fully.

### Mode Flow — Valid Transitions

Users may invoke any mode directly by supplying the required inputs.
The table below defines what is needed and what happens next.

| From | To | Required Input | Auto-Action |
|------|----|----------------|-------------|
| *(start)* | **CREATE** | Natural language description | Inversion elicitation → 9-phase pipeline |
| *(start)* | **LEAN** | Skill file content or path | Heuristic scoring → PASS/UNCERTAIN/FAIL |
| *(start)* | **EVALUATE** | Skill file content | 4-phase pipeline → certification |
| *(start)* | **OPTIMIZE** | Skill file content + EVALUATE report | 7-dim 9-step loop |
| *(start)* | **INSTALL** | Platform name (optional) | Deploy to target platforms |
| **CREATE** | **LEAN** | *(auto)* — output of CREATE | Fast quality gate |
| **CREATE** | **EVALUATE** | *(auto)* — if LEAN UNCERTAIN | Full certification |
| **LEAN** | **EVALUATE** | LEAN UNCERTAIN result | Full pipeline |
| **LEAN** | **OPTIMIZE** | LEAN FAIL result | Improvement loop |
| **EVALUATE** | **OPTIMIZE** | EVALUATE FAIL result | Improvement loop |
| **OPTIMIZE** | **LEAN** | *(auto)* — after each round | Fast re-score check |
| **OPTIMIZE** | **EVALUATE** | *(optional)* — after loop converges | Full re-certification |
| Any | **INSTALL** | Certified skill content | Platform deployment |

> **OPTIMIZE → EVALUATE policy**: After the OPTIMIZE loop converges:
> - If final LEAN score ≥ 450 (GOLD proxy) → LEAN_CERT is sufficient; EVALUATE is optional.
> - If final LEAN score 350–449 → run full EVALUATE to confirm tier.
> - If final LEAN score < 350 → EVALUATE is mandatory (loop may not have converged properly).

## §5  LoongFlow Orchestration

Every mode executes via Plan-Execute-Summarize:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLAN                                                    │
│  Multi-pass self-review → consensus on approach           │
│  Build cognitive graph of steps                          │
│  Extended spec: refs/self-review.md               │

│  Route: CERTIFIED | TEMP_CERT | HUMAN_REVIEW | ABORT     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Inline Error Recovery Rules `[ENFORCED — no companion file required]`

These rules apply regardless of whether `refs/self-review.md` is available:

| Error Type | Recovery Action |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Phase output missing** (e.g. GENERATE produced no skill text) | Retry once with explicit output instruction; if still missing → HUMAN_REVIEW |
| **Security P0 detected mid-phase** | ABORT immediately; halt all subsequent phases |
| **LEAN score < 300 after GENERATE** | Do NOT deliver; auto-route to targeted OPTIMIZE for lowest dimension |
| **Checkpoint gate fails** (e.g. placeholders remain after Phase 4) | Re-run the failed phase once; if still failing → flag TEMP_CERT + advisory |
| **Companion file unavailable** (refs/ not loaded) | Proceed with inline rules only; note "companion file unavailable" in output; do NOT abort |
| **User provides no answer to elicitation Q** (§7) | Skip with default + WARNING; do NOT block if user skips > 2 questions |
| **External fetch fails** (INSTALL mode) | Retry once after 2s; if still fails → ask user for local path |

**Escalation rule**: After any two consecutive phase failures → escalate to HUMAN_REVIEW immediately rather than attempting further retries.

### HUMAN_REVIEW Protocol — 场景适配 / Scenario-Adapted

When HUMAN_REVIEW is triggered, adapt the output message to the user's context:

**个人用户 / Individual user** (default):
```
⚠ HUMAN_REVIEW 触发 — AI 无法自动继续
Human review required — cannot proceed automatically.

## §6  CREATE Mode

> Full spec extracted — see reference below.

9-phase pipeline: ELICIT → SELECT TEMPLATE → PLAN → GENERATE → SECURITY SCAN → LEAN → FULL EVALUATE → INJECT UTE → DELIVER.

**Default is test-first.** Before GENERATE, the mode asks the user for a trigger-eval set (≥ 10 should-trigger + ≥ 10 should-not-trigger queries, or accepts `eval/trigger-eval.example.json`). After GENERATE, it runs `scripts/run_trigger_eval.py` and reports precision/recall/f1 alongside the LEAN score. Rubric-only delivery is allowed but flagged `validation_status: lean-only`.

Full spec: [`refs/modes/create.md`](../refs/modes/create.md)

## §15  Usage Examples

### Create an API integration skill

```
Input: "创建一个调用OpenWeather API返回摄氏温度的skill"
Mode: CREATE | Template: api-integration | Language: ZH

→ Elicit (6 questions answered)
→ Generate from api-integration template
→ Security scan: CWE-798 CLEAR, CWE-89 CLEAR
→ LEAN eval: 460/500 → estimated 920 → GOLD proxy → escalate to full EVALUATE
→ Full eval: Phase1=95 Phase2=285 Phase3=385 Phase4=175 Total=940
→ Variance = |285/3 - 385/4| = |95 - 96.25| = 1.25 < 15 → GOLD ✓
→ CERTIFIED GOLD: weather-query v1.0.0
```

### LEAN fast check

```
Input: "lean eval my-skill.md"
Mode: LEAN | Duration: ~1s

→ YAML present ✓ (60), §modes ✓ (60), 严禁 ✓ (50), thresholds ✓ (60),
  examples ✓ (50), triggers ✓ (120), security section ✓ (50), no placeholders ✓ (50)
→ lean_score = 500 → estimated 1000 → PLATINUM proxy
→ LEAN PASS | LEAN_CERT | Schedule full EVALUATE within 24 h
```

### Evaluate and optimize a failing skill

```
Input: "evaluate skill, F1 is 0.82"
Mode: EVALUATE → auto-route to OPTIMIZE on FAIL

→ Phase1=88 Phase2=201 Phase3=285 Phase4=110 Total=684 → FAIL (< 700)
→ Variance = |201/3 - 285/4| = |67 - 71.25| = 4.25 → low, consistent failure
→ Lowest dimension: Workflow Definition (55/100)
→ OPTIMIZE cycle 1: Strategy S2 (fill missing sections) → +38pts
→ OPTIMIZE cycle 2: Strategy S1 (expand keywords) → +22pts
→ Re-evaluate: Total=744 → BRONZE ✓
→ CERTIFIED BRONZE: skill v1.1.0
```

### OPTIMIZE loop — what each round looks like

```
Input: "optimize this skill" [pastes skill with LEAN score 340]
Mode: OPTIMIZE | Strategy: Auto | Starting score: 340/500
