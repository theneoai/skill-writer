## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### ✨ Added

- **COLLECT Mode (§18)** — structured session artifact recording; fires after every skill invocation when UTE is enabled; enables collective skill evolution via the AGGREGATE pipeline
- **AGGREGATE Mode** — multi-session distillation pipeline (Summarize → Aggregate → Execute) synthesizing N session artifacts into ranked improvement signals
- **`refs/session-artifact.md`** — canonical Session Artifact schema (skill_id, outcome, prm_signal, dimension_observations, causal-chain summary); SkillClaw-compatible format
- **`refs/edit-audit.md`** — Edit Audit Guard: classifies OPTIMIZE changes as MICRO/MINOR/MAJOR/REWRITE; blocks destructive rewrites (>50% content change); prevents skill drift
- **`refs/skill-registry.md`** — Skill Registry spec: deterministic SHA-256[:12] IDs, 20-entry version history, push/pull/sync SHARE protocol, conflict resolution with LLM-based merge
- **UTE 2.0 two-tier architecture** — L1 (single-user, `[ENFORCED]`, current behavior) + L2 (collective, `[ASPIRATIONAL]`, requires COLLECT + AGGREGATE pipeline)
- **Edit guard integration in UTE** — UTE micro-patches are now explicitly bounded to MICRO class; structural changes escalate to full OPTIMIZE
- `skill_id` field convention — SHA-256[:12] identifier added to YAML frontmatter spec for registry-enabled skills

### 🔧 Fixed

- **`validate.js` false positive** — placeholder check now strips fenced code blocks before scanning; `{{SKILL_NAME}}`, `{{INJECTION_DATE}}`, etc. inside template snippets no longer flagged as build errors
- **`skill-framework.md §15` stale version** — `{{FRAMEWORK_VERSION}}` fill instruction updated from `"2.1.0"` to `"2.2.0"`
- **README.md scoring** — `code-reviewer` corrected to GOLD 947/1000 (was incorrectly listed as SILVER 820/1000); average updated to 920.7/1000

### 📐 Architecture

- `builder/src/config.js` — three new `refs/` files added to `REQUIRED_FILES` (session-artifact, edit-audit, skill-registry)
- `ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md` — new Section 十 synthesizing SkillClaw research into product and architecture design recommendations

### 📋 Background

The v3.0 additions are informed by SkillClaw (arxiv.org/abs/2604.08377, AMAP-ML), which
demonstrated that collective skill evolution from multi-user session data outperforms
single-user optimization — "not by using a bigger model, but by leveraging smarter experience."

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Variable shadowing in `embedder.js`** — `embedCreateMode`, `embedEvaluateMode`, `embedOptimizeMode`, and `embedSharedResources` all used `const config = DEFAULT_CONFIG` which shadowed the module-level `config` import; renamed to `platformCfg` throughout
- **Input mutation bug in `opencode.js`** — `skillContent +=` mutated the function parameter; replaced with immutable local variable `formatted`
- **`validateEmbeddedContent` narrow regex** — placeholder detection used `/\{\{\w+\}\}/g` which missed `{{OUTER-KEY}}` and `{{outer.key}}` style markers; now uses `/\{\{[\w.-]+\}\}/g` with deduplication
- **`validate.js` missing JSON output checks** — only `.md` files were validated; now also validates `.json` outputs for MCP (schema_version, name, tools[]) and OpenAI (name, instructions)
- **`validate.js` placeholder regex** — upgraded from `/\{\{[A-Z_0-9]+\}\}/` to `/\{\{[\w.-]+\}\}/` to match extended placeholder patterns in generated files
- **MCP adapter empty description** — `mcp.formatSkill()` now falls back to inline body extraction when YAML frontmatter is absent (H1 title → kebab-case name; blockquote/first paragraph → description)
- **`openclaw.js` REQUIRED_SECTIONS mis-alignment** — `## §1 Identity` was listed as required but never injected by `formatSkill()`; removed from REQUIRED_SECTIONS (adapter guarantees only sections it injects: §4 LoongFlow, §9 Self-Review)
- **CLI validate exit code** — `skill-writer-builder validate` now exits with code 1 when `result.valid === false`, enabling CI pipeline integration

### ✨ Added

- **MCP platform support** — 7th platform adapter (`builder/src/platforms/mcp.js`) generating JSON manifests conforming to Model Context Protocol schema v1.0; includes `schema_version`, `tools[]`, `capabilities`, and `resources[]`
- **`MarkdownAdapter` base class** — shared base for Claude, Gemini adapters; extended to OpenCode via `OpenCodeAdapter extends MarkdownAdapter`
- **Integration test suite** (`builder/tests/unit/integration.test.js`) — 30 new end-to-end tests covering the full `reader → embedder → adapter` pipeline for all 7 platforms
- **Adapter tests for all 7 platforms** — added full test coverage for OpenCode (11 tests), OpenClaw (12), Cursor (9), OpenAI (10)

### 🔧 Changed

- **`opencode.js` refactored to `OpenCodeAdapter extends MarkdownAdapter`** — eliminates ~100 lines of duplicate code; XDG install path (`~/.config/opencode/skills`) preserved via `getInstallPath()` override
- **`MarkdownAdapter.generateMetadata()` dynamic version** — `testedVersions` array now reads current version from `package.json` dynamically instead of a hardcoded list
- **Scoring alignment** — `eval/rubrics.md` Phase 2 updated to match `config.js` canonical 7-dimension schema: Workflow Definition reduced from 20% (60 pts) to 15% (45 pts); former "Metadata Quality" (10%, 30 pts) split into "Security Baseline" (10%, 30 pts) + "Metadata Quality" (5%, 15 pts); Phase 2 total unchanged at 300 pts
- **`config.js` SCORING documentation** — added precise dimension ↔ rubric mapping table; clarified Phase 2 vs Phase 4 security gate distinction
- **`ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md` updated to v2.2.0** — documents all fixes, test expansion, and adds §10 (v2.2.0 architecture improvements)

### 📊 Metrics

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### 🔧 Simplified

- Replaced Multi-LLM deliberation (3-LLM Generator/Reviewer/Arbiter) with **multi-pass self-review** protocol — realistic for single-LLM AI platforms
- Simplified UTE (Use-to-Evolve) from automated post-invocation hooks to **AI-followed protocol convention** — no longer assumes programmatic execution
- Established **Single Source of Truth** — each concept defined in exactly one Markdown file

### ✨ Added

- `refs/self-review.md` — 3-pass self-review protocol (Generate → Review → Reconcile) replacing the unrealizable 3-LLM system

### 🗑️ Removed

- Deleted entire `core/` directory (~5700 lines of duplicated YAML and README content)
- Deleted `refs/deliberation.md` (replaced by `refs/self-review.md`)
- Deleted `eval/pairwise.md` (over-engineered Bradley-Terry pairwise ranking)
- Deleted `builder/templates/claude.md` (duplicated `skill-framework.md`)

### 📈 Impact

- Project reduced from ~87 files / ~9600 lines to ~55 files / ~6000 lines
- Builder now reads directly from Markdown companion files (no YAML intermediary)
- All LLM-1/LLM-2/LLM-3 references updated to Pass 1/Pass 2/Pass 3

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-01

### ✨ Added

- **LEAN Fast-Eval Mode** — 500-point heuristic evaluator (~1 s, no LLM calls); 8-check rubric with PASS/UNCERTAIN/FAIL decision gates
- **UTE (Use-to-Evolve)** — self-improvement protocol; every skill gains a `§UTE` section and `use_to_evolve:` YAML block; post-invocation hook records usage, detects feedback signals, runs cadence-gated trigger checks (lightweight/full-recompute/tier-drift)
- **LoongFlow Orchestration** — Plan-Execute-Summarize replaces rigid state machines; supports multi-LLM deliberation with consensus check
- **Variance gating** — certification tier requires both score AND variance check: PLATINUM <10, GOLD <15, SILVER <20, BRONZE <30
- **install-claude.sh** — new install script that copies `skill-framework.md` AND companion directories (`refs/`, `templates/`, `eval/`, `optimize/`) to `~/.claude/` so all `claude/` path references resolve at runtime

### 🔄 Changed

- **Canonical rubric**: Phase 1=100 / Phase 2=300 / Phase 3=400 / Phase 4=200 (total 1000)
- **Certification thresholds**: PLATINUM ≥950, GOLD ≥900, SILVER ≥800, BRONZE ≥700, FAIL <700
- **Example skill scores** re-evaluated with v2.0.0 rubric (see table below)
- **`install:claude`** now invokes `install-claude.sh` instead of a single `cp` command
- **`builder/templates/claude.md`**: version bumped to 2.0.0; added LEAN mode triggers; added ZH triggers for all four modes; scoring rubric corrected to 4-phase structure; `interface:` frontmatter field added
- **`builder/src/commands/inspect.js`**: `getBuiltSkillPath` now checks flat `skill-writer-<platform>-dev.md` pattern first, fixing inspect for all platforms
- **`builder/src/commands/build.js`**: adds `p0_count`, `p1_count`, `p2_count`, `p3_count`, `generated_at` to `skillMetadata` so security stats render correctly
- `package.json` version bumped 1.0.0 → 2.0.0; `yourusername` placeholders replaced with `theneoai`
- CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md: `yourusername` placeholders replaced with `theneoai`

### 🔧 Fixed

- All three example skills: injected complete `§UTE` body section and `use_to_evolve:` YAML with all 11 fields
- `code-reviewer/skill.md`: all section headers converted to `## §N` format; Red Lines (§3) added; `created`/`updated` dates added
- `doc-generator/skill.md`: LEAN, evaluate, optimize, 快评, 评测, 优化 triggers added to trigger line
- `api-tester/skill.md`: `{{API_BASE_URL}}` placeholder replaced; `certified_lean_score` corrected 470 → 390; UTE YAML completed with all 11 fields
- All three `eval-report.md` files: rewritten to use canonical 100/300/400/200 rubric and correct certification thresholds (GOLD ≥900, SILVER ≥800)
- `skill-framework.md`: PATH CONVENTION comment block added; `updated` date refreshed
