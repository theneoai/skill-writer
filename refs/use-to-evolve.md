# Use-to-Evolve (UTE) Specification

> **Purpose**: Protocol for injecting self-improvement capability into any skill.
> **Load**: When §15 (UTE Injection) of `claude/skill-writer.md` is accessed.
> **Main doc**: `claude/skill-writer.md §15`

> | Feedback signal detection (correction / approval) | `[CORE]` | Observable within a single turn |
> | Trigger miss detection (user rephrasing) | `[CORE]` | Observable within session |
> | Micro-patch proposal & user confirmation | `[CORE]` | Single-session action |
> | LEAN score after micro-patch | `[CORE]` | Computed in same session |
> | `cumulative_invocations` counter | `[EXTENDED]` | Resets across LLM sessions |

## §1  Concept

**Use-to-Evolve** (UTE) makes a skill self-improving through actual use.
The AI, upon recognizing a `use_to_evolve:` block in a skill's YAML frontmatter,
follows this protocol to observe usage patterns and propose improvements.

```
User invokes skill
        │
        ▼
  Skill executes normally
        │
        ▼
  AI observes outcome
    ├─ Note feedback signal (correction / approval / none)
    ├─ Track trigger misses (user rephrased request)
    └─ Periodically assess skill health
              │
    ┌─────────┴──────────┐
    │ no action needed   │ improvement identified
    └─────────┬──────────┘       │
              │             ASSESS severity
              ▼                  │
          continue        ┌──────┴──────┐
                      MICRO  |     SUGGEST
                      PATCH  |     OPTIMIZE
                     (minor) |    (structural)
```

**Key constraint**: The skill never self-modifies mid-session.
Patches are proposed to the user; applied only on confirmation.

---

## §2  YAML Frontmatter Block

Every skill with UTE enabled **must** include a `use_to_evolve:` block in its YAML frontmatter with all 13 fields:

```yaml
use_to_evolve:
  enabled: true                          # (bool) UTE active
  injected_by: "skill-writer v3.4.0"    # (string) injector version
  injected_at: "2026-04-01"             # (ISO-8601) injection date
  check_cadence:                         # (dict) invocation thresholds
    lightweight: 10                      #   lightweight check every N invocations
    full_recompute: 50                   #   full metric recompute every N
    tier_drift: 100                      #   tier drift check every N
  micro_patch_enabled: true             # (bool) allow trigger keyword patches
  feedback_detection: true              # (bool) detect user feedback signals
  certified_lean_score: 390             # (int) baseline LEAN score for drift detection
  last_ute_check: null                  # (ISO-8601 | null) when last check ran
  pending_patches: 0                    # (int) staged but unapplied patches
  total_micro_patches_applied: 0        # (int) cumulative patches applied
  cumulative_invocations: 0             # (int) total invocations (cadence counter)
  generation_method: "human-authored"   # (string) auto-generated | human-authored | hybrid
  validation_status: "lean-only"        # (string) unvalidated | lean-only | full-eval | pragmatic-verified
```

> **Note**: Phase 4 certification checks that all 13 fields are present. Missing any field fails the UTE injection check (−60 points). The two v3.4.0 fields (`generation_method`, `validation_status`) affect Skill Summary heuristic ranking and SHARE gate behavior — see `refs/security-patterns.md §6` for supply chain trust integration.

## §3  Feedback Signal Detection

When the AI observes user responses after skill output, it classifies the feedback:

| Signal | What the AI Looks For | Classification |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **correction** | "that's wrong", "不对", user provides alternative | `failure` |
| **rephrasing** | Same request rephrased without acceptance | `trigger_miss` |
| **approval** | "thanks", "perfect", "好的", user proceeds normally | `success` |
| **abandon** | Topic switches or session ends immediately | `ambiguous` |
| **none** | No follow-up signal | `neutral` |

**On correction**: Note that the skill produced incorrect output — indicates need for OPTIMIZE.
**On rephrasing**: Note the alternative phrasing as a trigger keyword candidate.
**On repeated pattern** (≥3 similar corrections): Propose a micro-patch or suggest OPTIMIZE.

---

## §4  Cadence-Gated Health Checks

The AI performs periodic assessments based on approximate invocation counts:

### Every ~10 invocations: Lightweight Check
- Review recent interactions: Are users getting what they need?
- Note recurring trigger misses or corrections
- If repeated failures detected → propose micro-patch or suggest OPTIMIZE

### Every ~50 invocations: Quality Assessment
- Estimate overall skill health: trigger accuracy, output quality, user satisfaction
- Compare against quality thresholds (F1 ≥ 0.90, MRR ≥ 0.85, trigger_accuracy ≥ 0.90)
- On any threshold concern → suggest running EVALUATE or OPTIMIZE

### Every ~100 invocations: Tier Drift Check
- Estimate whether skill quality has drifted from its certified baseline
- If significant drift detected (estimated score drop > 50 pts) → suggest full EVALUATE

---

## §5  Micro-Patch Protocol

Micro-patches are **atomic, minor changes** proposed for surface-level improvements.
They NEVER affect the skill's core logic — only trigger keywords or metadata.

### Eligible Changes (Micro-Patch)

| Change | Condition | Scope |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Add trigger keyword | ≥3 users rephrased with same term | YAML + mode trigger list |
| Add ZH trigger | ZH input frequently unrecognized | Mode trigger list |
| Update `updated` date | Any patch applied | YAML frontmatter only |
| Bump patch version | Any patch applied | YAML `version` field |

### Ineligible Changes (Must OPTIMIZE)

- Structural section changes (add/remove phases)
- Output contract changes
- Security baseline changes
- Any change touching Red Lines

### Patch Application

1. **PROPOSE** — AI describes the patch and reason to the user
2. **CONFIRM** — User approves or rejects
3. **APPLY** — AI applies the change
4. **VERIFY** — Run LEAN eval on patched version; rollback if score drops > 10 pts

---

## §6  Safety Constraints

| Constraint | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| No mid-session modification | Propose patches; never apply during active task |
| User confirmation required | All patches require explicit user approval |
| Rollback always available | Pre-patch version can be restored |
| Structural changes blocked | Only trigger keywords and metadata eligible |
| Security scan required | Check for P0 patterns before applying any patch |
| Patch size limit | Max 5 micro-patches per skill per session |
| Edit guard integration | All UTE patches are MICRO class; structural changes escalate to OPTIMIZE (see `refs/edit-audit.md`) |

---

## §7  UTE 2.0 — Two-Tier Architecture

UTE operates at two tiers. Both tiers share the same feedback signals and micro-patch
protocol; they differ in *scope* (single-user vs. multi-user) and *persistence requirements*.

### L1: Single-User UTE (current)

- **Scope**: One user, one session, one skill
- **Enforcement**: `[CORE]` — runs fully within a single LLM session
- **Trigger source**: Feedback signals observed in the current conversation
- **Output**: Micro-patch proposals (keywords/metadata) or OPTIMIZE queue entries
- **State**: Session-local only; no cross-session persistence required

This is the complete implementation described in §1–§6 above.

---

## §8  Platform Hook Integration `[ENFORCED with hooks backend]`

> This section upgrades UTE's `[EXTENDED]` cross-session items to `[CORE]` by
> wiring them to the host platform's hook system. Currently documented for **Claude Code**
> (session hooks). The same pattern applies to any platform that exposes pre/post-session hooks.

### What Changes With Hooks

| UTE Item | Without Hooks | With Hooks |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| `cumulative_invocations` counter | `[EXTENDED]` — resets per session | `[CORE]` — persisted to file |
| Cadence checks (every 10/50/100) | `[EXTENDED]` — approximate | `[CORE]` — precise count-gated |
| `last_ute_check` / `pending_patches` | `[EXTENDED]` — cross-session state lost | `[CORE]` — read/written via hook |
| Audit trail in `.skill-audit/` | `[EXTENDED]` — requires filesystem | `[CORE]` — hook writes on session end |

### Claude Code Hook Setup

#### 1. Create the UTE state file

For each UTE-enabled skill, create a JSON state file alongside the skill:

```bash
# Example: for a skill at ~/.claude/skills/my-skill.md
touch ~/.claude/skills/.ute-state/my-skill.json
```

Initial state file contents:
```json
{
  "skill_name": "my-skill",
  "skill_path": "~/.claude/skills/my-skill.md",
  "cumulative_invocations": 0,
  "last_ute_check": null,
  "pending_patches": 0,
  "total_micro_patches_applied": 0,
  "certified_lean_score": 390,
  "session_log": []
}
```

#### 2. Register a Claude Code PostToolUse hook

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node ~/.claude/hooks/ute-tracker.js post-use \"$CLAUDE_SKILL_NAME\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node ~/.claude/hooks/ute-tracker.js session-end"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 3. ute-tracker.js — Minimal hook script

Create `~/.claude/hooks/ute-tracker.js`:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// UTE state persistence hook for Claude Code
// Upgrades [EXTENDED] cross-session tracking to [CORE]

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const STATE_DIR = path.join(process.env.HOME, '.claude', 'skills', '.ute-state');
const cmd = process.argv[2];       // 'post-use' | 'session-end'
const skillName = process.argv[3]; // skill identifier from env

function readState(name) {
  const file = path.join(STATE_DIR, `${name}.json`);
  if (!fs.existsSync(file)) return null;
  return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8'));
}

function writeState(name, state) {
  fs.mkdirSync(STATE_DIR, { recursive: true });
  const file = path.join(STATE_DIR, `${name}.json`);
  fs.writeFileSync(file, JSON.stringify(state, null, 2));
}

if (cmd === 'post-use' && skillName) {
  const state = readState(skillName) || { cumulative_invocations: 0, session_log: [] };
  state.cumulative_invocations += 1;

  // Cadence gate: log when thresholds hit
  const inv = state.cumulative_invocations;
  if (inv % 10 === 0)  state.session_log.push({ at: new Date().toISOString(), event: 'lightweight_check_due', inv });
  if (inv % 50 === 0)  state.session_log.push({ at: new Date().toISOString(), event: 'quality_assessment_due', inv });
  if (inv % 100 === 0) state.session_log.push({ at: new Date().toISOString(), event: 'tier_drift_check_due', inv });

  writeState(skillName, state);
}

if (cmd === 'session-end') {
  // Write session summary to audit trail
  const auditDir = path.join(process.env.HOME, '.claude', '.skill-audit');
  fs.mkdirSync(auditDir, { recursive: true });
  const entry = { session_end: new Date().toISOString(), skills_active: skillName || 'unknown' };
  const auditFile = path.join(auditDir, 'sessions.jsonl');
  fs.appendFileSync(auditFile, JSON.stringify(entry) + '\n');
}
```

#### 4. How Claude reads UTE state at session start

In your system prompt or session-start hook, inject the current state:

```bash
# Add to ~/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh
SKILL_STATE=$(cat ~/.claude/skills/.ute-state/my-skill.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}')
echo "UTE_STATE: $SKILL_STATE" >> /tmp/claude-session-context.txt
```

Then reference in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
At session start, read /tmp/claude-session-context.txt.
If UTE_STATE contains `session_log` entries with `_due` events,
notify the user and offer to run the corresponding UTE health check.
```

### Enforcement Status After Hook Integration

With the above setup, these items upgrade from `[EXTENDED]` to `[CORE]`:

| Item | New Status |
|------|-----------|
| `cumulative_invocations` persistence | `[CORE]` — written by PostToolUse hook |
| Cadence check notifications | `[CORE]` — session_log entries trigger next-session prompt |
| `last_ute_check` update | `[CORE]` — written by session-end hook |
| Audit trail | `[CORE]` — sessions.jsonl append on Stop |

**Remaining `[EXTENDED]` items** (require L2 collective infrastructure):
- Multi-user artifact aggregation (collective-evolution design / reinforcement-style evolution design collective pipeline)
- Cross-skill tier drift monitoring (requires shared registry backend)

---

### L2: Collective UTE `[EXTENDED]`

> **`[EXTENDED]`**: L2 requires external storage and the COLLECT + AGGREGATE pipeline.
> See `refs/session-artifact.md` and `skill-framework.md §17` for full spec.

- **Scope**: Multiple users, multiple sessions, one skill (or skill cluster)
- **Enforcement**: `[EXTENDED]` — requires Session Artifact storage and AGGREGATE pipeline
- **Trigger source**: Aggregated patterns from N session artifacts
- **Output**: Evidence-backed evolution proposals (stronger signal than single-session L1)
- **State**: Persistent storage (`sessions/` directory in shared storage backend)

**Key insight** (from collective-evolution design research): L2 collective evolution produces measurably better
skills than L1 single-user optimization — not because of bigger models, but because broader
usage data reveals blind spots that single-user testing misses.

### Relationship between tiers

```
Single user interacts with skill
         │
         ▼
L1 UTE fires (every session)
   ├─ Detect feedback signals
   ├─ Propose micro-patches
   └─ Generate Session Artifact (if COLLECT mode active)
         │
         ▼ (optional, requires backend)
L2 Collective pipeline
   ├─ Session Artifact → sessions/ queue
   ├─ AGGREGATE (Summarize → Aggregate → Execute)
   └─ Cross-user evolution proposals → stronger OPTIMIZE suggestions
```

### L2 Minimum Viable Flow (no backend required)

Even without an external backend, L2 benefits are accessible manually:

1. User runs COLLECT mode after each session → downloads Session Artifact JSON
2. After N sessions (or across multiple users sharing artifacts): paste artifacts into AGGREGATE mode
3. AGGREGATE synthesizes cross-session patterns into ranked improvement list
4. Apply improvements via standard OPTIMIZE mode

This manual flow degrades gracefully to near-L2 quality with zero infrastructure cost.
